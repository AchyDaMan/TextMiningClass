But Belgian-born Dutchman Max Verstappen was unable to drive a car legally on his own in either country.That all changed on Wednesday when the youngster turned 18 and passed his driving test at the first attempt.Despite having competed in 14 grands prix since his debut in Australia in March, Verstappen admitted to feeling the pressure during his test."It's a relief," said the Toro Rosso driver, who finished ninth in Japan on Sunday and had only started driving lessons a week ago. "I was a bit nervous to make mistakes, but the exam went well."A bonus of turning 18 is that Verstappen will now be able to drink the champagne if he ever makes it onto the podium.
European leaders gathered in the Polish port of Gdansk for a midnight ceremony at the site where the first shots of the war were fired.The Gdansk commemoration was seen as a slight to Russia's Victory Parade on Saturday, which has been boycotted by Western leaders because of Ukraine.There will also be ceremonies in Paris, London, Berlin, as well as Washington.The commemoration in Gdansk was marked with a 21-gun salute on the stroke of midnight. Beams of light illuminated a monument to Polish defenders in Westerplatte and the national anthem was played.In a speech, Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski said the war had started with the co-operation of two totalitarian regimes led by Hitler and Stalin.He went on to say that the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945 did not bring freedom but instead communism and the Iron Curtain. Such division finally ended, the president said, with the integration of the region into the European Union.The event was attended by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the presidents of several countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania and Ukraine.But many other Western leaders - who are boycotting Moscow's event and for whom the Gdansk commemoration was partly organised - did not attend.Among those in Gdansk was Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko who said it was possible to draw parallels from history and the current situation in Europe."Annexation and invasion, under the pretext of defending ethnic minorities... could all become the new reality," he said.Relations between Russia and the West have been soured by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula last year and support for rebels in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.Moscow denies it is arming the rebels and sending troops across the border.Russia, which lost more citizens to the war than any other nation, will stage its biggest-ever military parade during its Victory ceremony in Moscow's Red Square on Saturday.Later on Friday, there will be a ceremony in Germany where President Joachim Gauck will lay a wreath at a cemetery for Soviet soldiers. The German parliament will meet in special session.In London, a remembrance service will be held at the Cenotaph and 200 beacons will later be lit across the country.In France, where VE (Victory in Europe) Day is a national holiday, President Francois Hollande will lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.In the US, a ceremony will be held at the national World War Two memorial in Washington followed by a flypast of vintage fighter planes.It was on 8 May 1945 that Allied forces accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, marking the end of the war in Europe. But it was not the end of WW2. It would take another three months before Japan surrendered.
The midfielder, 27,  has been inundated with messages of congratulations on social media following the birth of Raine on Friday night.Chairman of AFC Bournemouth Jeff Mostyn was among the first to congratulate Arter and his partner Rachel, tweeting: "Thrilled with the incredible news."Their daughter Renee was stillborn in December 2015.AFC Bournemouth also congratulated Arter on the news, tweeting: "From one family to another, congratulations."Arter responded to the support on Twitter, saying: "Thank you to everyone for all of your kind messages", adding an emoji rainbow and a heart."Rainbow baby" is a phrase used by some parents who have lost a child through a miscarriage or stillbirth as they compare their subsequent child to a beautiful sight after a storm.TV cameras caught an emotional moment after Bournemouth's match against Manchester City on Monday when City manager Pep Guardiola embraced Arter and offered his best wishes for the imminent birth.Arter said at the time: "He's someone I have massive respect for. I watched his Barcelona teams and he is, without doubt, the best manager in the world."Messages have also been sent to the couple from numerous other clubs and fans.Leeds United's Liam Cooper tweeted: "Congrats mate", while a section of the club's fans tweeted: "Lovely to see the football world come together to congratulate you - congrats Harry."Elsewhere, Stourbridge Wolves tweeted: "Fantastic news, congratulations from all Stourbridge FC fans."
The former Northern Ireland international, who died last week, was remembered with a minute's applause and a video tribute following a career that saw him score more than 140 goals for the club.On the pitch, however, the Bantams were looking for a response to the loss at Roots Hall and they started in positive fashion.Mark McNulty and Nicky Law each had shots deflected for corners and Bradford twice appealed in vain for a penalty, with Hanson and McNulty both going down inside the area to no avail.The hosts continued to press after the interval as Haris Vuckic and Law went close before the home side's pressure paid off in the 56th minute.Vuckic's overhit cross from the right was kept in play by Mark Marshall, who clipped the ball into the area where Hanson scored with a header from close range.However, Northampton came close to equalising when only a brilliant one-handed save by Colin Doyle kept out Alex Revell's header from Paul Anderson's cross, before substitute Marc Richards had the ball in the net in the 84th minute only to be ruled offside.Report supplied by Press Association.Match ends, Bradford City 1, Northampton Town 0.Second Half ends, Bradford City 1, Northampton Town 0.John-Joe O'Toole (Northampton Town) is shown the yellow card.Romain Vincelot (Bradford City) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Foul by Alex Revell (Northampton Town).Nicky Law (Bradford City) is shown the yellow card.Foul by James Hanson (Bradford City).John-Joe O'Toole (Northampton Town) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Substitution, Bradford City.

The "truly wicked, marauding mob" stabbed Sean McHugh, 19,  with a "sword stick" in Anfield on 30 September 2013.Reese O'Shaughnessy, 19, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years after he was convicted alongside four others.Andrew Hewitt, 15, Keyfer Dykstra, Corey Hewitt and Joseph McGill, all 14, were also detained by Liverpool Crown Court.Dykstra was sentenced to a minimum of 12 years, Andrew Hewitt and McGill were sentenced to a minimum of nine years and Corey Hewitt for a minimum of six years.Judge Clement Goldstone described Mr McHugh's killers as "a marauding mob"."Each of you has been convicted of the murder of Sean McHugh - a truly wicked attack in which each of you played different roles," Justice Goldstone said.A victim impact statement from Mr McHugh's mother Lorraine that was read in court said: "They might as well have killed me."The teenagers were part of a gang known as the Lane Heads, a rival gang to the Walton Village Heads which Mr McHugh was linked to.Months earlier, Dykstra was stabbed in the chest by a member of the Walton Village Heads and wanted to "avenge that stabbing", the court heard."The stabbing was avenged not by attacking the person responsible, but by attacking someone... by virtue of his affiliation to the Walton Village Heads," Justice Goldstone said.The gang targeted Mr McHugh, of Beckett Street, Liverpool, after a minor dispute and found him at the Priory Road launderette, where he had left his washing, at about 19:00 BST.Armed with knives and the makeshift sword stick, described as similar to a broom handle but with a blade attached, the gang forced the back door to the room where Mr McHugh was hiding.He was beaten and stabbed before the group ran out.Mr McHugh escaped and was found in an alleyway having been stabbed in the groin. He died a few days later in hospital from blood loss.
Serial burglar Darren February, 34 and of no fixed address, denies breaking into Mr Cowell's west London home while he was asleep in December 2015.Isleworth Crown Court heard traces of Mr February's DNA was discovered on a glove found dropped nearby.It was also found on a mark on the side of the entrance steps, the court heard.A forensic expert said the discovery meant it was possible that the defendant, who has been convicted of 37 burglaries, wore the gloves to steal a diamond ring, earrings and watches, before discarding them near the Holland Park home.Traces of other people's DNA were also found on the items tested, expert Sara Short said.In their report Ms Short and Rachel Pollard found that while "one possible explanation is that he had worn the gloves and discarded them" on 4 December, 2015, they could not conclusively state that he had "handled, worn or had direct contact with the gloves or had contact with the area (on the wall)."In cross examination, Ms Short agreed it was possible the defendant's DNA could have been transferred on to the gloves without him having worn them.But she agreed with prosecutor Denis Barry who suggested it would be unlucky for the defendant to have his DNA transferred to and found at the scene, if he had never been there or committed the crime.The court heard from a police officer who said he initially thought a man who broke in to the home of singer Rita Ora was pictured on CCTV from Mr Cowell's address.Two other officers said they had been able to identify Mr February from images captured at the scene.The trial continues.
Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe Dons took the lead when Jonny Hayes' corner landed at the near post, with Caley Thistle's Gary Warren deflecting in Ash Taylor's shot.Greg Tansey headed wide for the visitors, while Hayes, Kenny McLean and Niall McGinn all missed for the Dons.Miles Storey should have made it 2-0 but somehow got the ball caught under his feet on the goal line.The result moves Aberdeen 13 points clear of third-placed Rangers, with the two sides set to meet on Sunday at Pittodrie.Aberdeen may have been unable to mount a serious title challenge this season, but they are still on course for a record points tally after surpassing the run of home wins set by Sir Alex Ferguson's side in 1986.They now need 12 points from the last seven matches to do that, but an overall run of 12 victories in their last 14 Premiership matches suggests they are up to the task.Aberdeen impressed with their pace, intensity and variety of movement going forward in the first half, but the defence remains equally effective as they have now gone 531 minutes without conceding a goal.Of course this was another painful night for Caley Thistle manager Richie Foran in what has been a steep learning curve for the Dubliner in his first season in the job.No team in British senior football have won fewer league matches than the Highlanders this season and, while they are not yet entirely cut adrift at the bottom, time is fast running out to turn things around.The sight of five former Caley Thistle players in such an impressive Dons squad was compounded by the knowledge that current top league marksman Greg Tansey is moving to Pittodrie in the summer.The midfielder is desperate to leave with the club still in the Premiership, but he missed one of their best chances of the evening when he headed a Henri Anier cross over the bar from six yards in the first half.The real disappointment for Foran, though, will be that the goal they conceded was a gift for Aberdeen.It was poor marking by the Caley Thistle defence as Dons pair Taylor and Andrew Considine contested a Hayes corner, the ball eventually deflected in by captain Warren off Taylor's strike.Despite a battling performance, Caley Thistle simply could not find a way back into the match.They did have a late let off, though, when former Inverness player Storey had an incredible miss when he failed to convert from point-blank range after a Hayes shot came off the post.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: "We didn't have the same rhythm or flow to our game as we normally have, but there were a number of factors for that as we had the game in our pocket but didn't know whether to stick or twist."We are delighted to get the 10th home win on the bounce for the first time since that great Aberdeen side in 1986 with so many top players and a top manager in Sir Alex Ferguson."That keeps the distance between us and Rangers and we just look forward to playing them here on Sunday now but we have a lot of hard games left."Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "We had chances to go one up but we didn't take them then we give a goal from a set-piece which was really disappointing."We work hard on defending those so it was a sloppy goal to give away and Aberdeen looked more confident than we did."We are not going to be judged on games against Aberdeen though. We have seven must win games left and I believe we can still get enough points to get out of trouble."Match ends, Aberdeen 1, Inverness CT 0.Second Half ends, Aberdeen 1, Inverness CT 0.Attempt blocked.

They were found wounded at a property in Elmshurst Crescent, East Finchley at about 06:25 BST.The Metropolitan Police named the two victims  - said to have moved to the UK from Congo in central Africa - as Anny Ekofo, 52, and her nephew Bervil Ekofo, 21.Mr Ekofo's mother said she had lost her "life" and her "best friend".Maymie Botamba said: "He was my life, they have taken my life away. He was my best friend."He was so lovely and kind to everyone, always surrounded by girls. He had never been in trouble before, he had never been in a fight in his life."The Met's homicide and major crime command unit is investigating.Mrs Ekofo's cousin, Fifi Selo, said the family was in shock and "cannot explain what happened"."They were an amazing family. Anny was the kind of person who was a mum to everybody. She always brought everybody together."Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene, police said.Local resident Lizzy Holsgrove said: "About 20 police cars and four or five paramedic cars, and three ambulances sped past my window."They cordoned off the street very quickly and police were sprinting from the top of the road where they'd stopped."There had been screaming before the police arrived."
Typhoon Phanfone has killed at least one person, a US airman on Okinawa who was washed away by high waves.Thousands of households have lost power and Japan's two largest airlines have suspended many flights.The storm also forced the suspension of the search for people missing after last week's volcanic eruption.The storm-tracking website Tropical Storm Risk forecasts that Phanfone will rapidly lose power over the next few hours as it goes further into the Pacific Ocean.Typhoon Phanfone was downgraded from an earlier status of a super typhoon, but the Japan Meteorological Agency had warned it was still a dangerous storm.Japan averages 11 typhoons a year, according to its weather agency.The typhoon made landfall on Monday morning near the central city of Hamamatsu, with winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph).The airman was one of three US military personnel swept away by high waves whipped up by the typhoon off southern Okinawa island, where the US has a large military base. The remaining two are still missing.A police spokesman said they had been taking photographs of the sea.A university student who was surfing off the seas of Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, was also missing, national broadcast NHK reports. It said at least 10 people had been injured and 9,500 houses were without power.The storm was expected to deposit about 100mm of rain on Tokyo over 24 hours, according to the Transport Ministry website.Many schools were closed on Monday and two car companies in Japan halted production at some plants ahead of the storm.More than 174 domestic flights were affected nationwide, NHK state broadcaster said on Sunday.On Sunday, heavy rain delayed the Japanese Formula One Grand Prix in Suzaka. French driver Jules Bianchi lost control in the wet conditions and crashed, sustaining a severe head injury.
He was brought in to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary by an offshore rescue helicopter from BG Group's North Everest platform, 145 miles east of Aberdeen.Aberdeen Coastguard, which co-ordinated the operation, said it was alerted at 11:30 on Sunday.There are no further details on his condition.
And not just the ecstasy of Salford Red Devils' 19-18 golden-point win in the Million Pound Game, but also the despair of beaten opponents Hull KR.If anything, it was reaction of the Hull KR players and their families that made the biggest impression on Kopczak."To see the wives and the families of the opposition crying and upset wasn't nice," he told BBC Wales Sport."It's not a nice position to be in and I wouldn't recommend it."You couldn't really celebrate and it was more a case of job done and get out of there."And that after securing the most important win in the history of the club, who had been within minutes of losing their Super League status.For the defeated Robins, it meant relegation and an uncertain future for the club's players, with contracts under threat.With so much at stake in one end-of-the season match, the Million Pound Game has been criticised since its introduction in 2015.Media playback is not supported on this deviceHull KR's Ben Cockayne described the concept as "a disgrace" and said it hurt the Rugby Football League's efforts to promote good mental health.Salford looked destined for relegation as the highly charged game at the Lightstream Stadium drew to a close.They trailed 18-10 with two minutes left but Niall Evalds' try and Greg Johnson's score with the last play of normal time levelled the scores.Gareth O'Brien's drop-goal in golden-point extra time secured victory to save his side from the drop to the Championship."At one stage I thought it was all over, but credit to the boys they dug deep and found a way to win," added Kopczak, who was among the Salford replacements."It's not good for the players but it is what it is. You've got to do it and someone's got to go down."Hopefully next season I'm not in that situation again. We've got a great bunch of lads and we shouldn't really have been in that situation."With Salford's Super League status secured, Kopczak's focus is now on another challenge - captaining Wales' attempt to reach the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.Wales, who won the European Championship in 2015, have qualifiers against Serbia at Llanelli's Stebonheath Park on Saturday and away to Italy on 29 October."We've got two tough games and it's going to be interesting," Kopczak said."But the boys are really up for it and we want to build on the success of last year."John Kear's side will face Serbia and Italy without Wigan's Ben Flower and Rhys Evans of Warrington Wolves, who are unavailable after playing in the Grand Final.Tyson Frizell, capped five times by Wales, is also unavailable having been included in Australia's squad for the Four Nations.But Kopczak says his own Super League experience, as well as that of Salford team mate Phil Joseph and Widnes pair Gil Dudson and Lloyd White, will help Wales."It's for us to lead from the front and get ourselves in a great position to start with and kick on from there," Kopczak said."We'll focus on ourselves, get the job done right and aim for the World Cup."
Allen scored his first international goal on his 32nd appearance in Wales' 4-0 win over Moldova in their opening 2018 World Cup qualifier.The 26-year-old joined Stoke City from Liverpool for £13m in July after only starting eight league games in 2015-16."I think it had come to the point where I needed to move on," Allen said."Personally, it was pretty obvious."Any player will tell you regular football makes tonnes of difference to the way you perform and the way you feel out on the football pitch."It comes to a certain stage in your career where if it's not happening then you have to go and seek it out."Hopefully I will get much more game time now and I think that is going to be really important for me in my international career as well."The Wales international joined Liverpool from Swansea City for £15m in the summer of 2012. He had a year left on his contract at Anfield but joined Stoke after starring for Wales at Euro 2016.Allen has been impressed by the calibre of players fellow Welshman Mark Hughes' has assembled at Stoke City.Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony signed on a season-long loan on transfer deadline day and joins a squad which includes Xherdan Shaqiri, Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic."It's pretty obvious that my type of play would not have suited Stoke years ago," Allen added"But the likes of Shaqiri, Arnautovic, Bojan, (Ibrahim) Afellay and (Giannelli) Imbula, players they have brought in - and others that were already there (Glenn) Whelan, Jonathan (Walters) and (Peter) Crouch - the list went on and on.Media playback is not supported on this device"It made it really appealing to me, and was one of the big reasons why I signed there."You have seen they have finished ninth three years running and they are not happy to settle for that. Now everyone is talking about the impact Bony will have at Stoke, and the boys who played with him at Swansea talk very highly of him."So I'm looking forward to getting back up there now and playing alongside him."Stoke City, bottom of the table after two defeats and a draw in their opening three games of the Premier League season, host Tottenham on Saturday.Chris Coleman's side are top of Group D after their opening win - and play away in Austria away and at home to Georgia in October."There was pressure on us to get off to a winning start and get those three points which was important for us," added Allen. "But to do it with four goals and in relative comfort in the end is just what we wanted."On a personal note to get the goal was a nice bonus as well."In the last few years at Liverpool I have played more as a holding player."But I feel there are a few types of positions and roles I can do."It's a good string to my bow to be able to do different things for the team."
And, on a drive between the Republican Convention in Cleveland, Ohio and the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, I gained an insight into another factor adding to the unpredictability - the growing numbers of Americans who are switching, or thinking of switching, party allegiances. In some cases, they are changing the voting habits of a lifetime.The first switcher was just a few blocks from the Republican convention location. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. A lifelong Republican, he believes that Mr Trump is not just telling tall stories, but dangerous ones."I am very concerned about any leader who appeals to the worst instincts of human nature. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party."So will he vote for Hillary Clinton? "I may. I haven't quite got there, but I definitely won't vote for Donald Trump. Anyone who knows me knows how ridiculous that sounds, that I would even think of voting for her."I heard a very different view in the run-down town of Warren, 50 miles east of Cleveland. At the 422 restaurant, the only place to eat on what local people say was once a bustling strip, I met a group of disillusioned Democrats. They used to work at the town's steel mill, which is now nothing more than a fenced-off patch of wasteland.As jobs, opportunities and hopes have disappeared, so too has the loyalty they felt - or were encouraged to feel by the unions - towards the Democratic Party. During the 35 years that Joe Shrodek worked in the mill's blast furnace, he always voted for Democratic presidential candidates. But not this time."When I was there I voted Democrat the whole time, the unions endorsed [the candidate]. All that's gone now. I just want change, that's all. They need to clean house in Washington."So, is Mr Trump the man to do that?"I don't know," he says, "but I'm voting for him."Watching Joe and his friends mop up the restaurant's roasted hot pepper dip with slices of white bread, local Republican Party chairman Randy Law predicts that Mr Trump will soak up the votes of many other white working class voters like them."I see it every day. People calling me, emailing me. There is this anti-Hillary feeling. People seeing it as a third term for Obama. People are fed up with a lot of those policies that have hurt big business, small business and trade and people are tired of being politically correct."Crossing the state line into Pennsylvania, another swing state, where polls suggest a tight contest, I encountered a different type of switcher. Judie Radel, who owns the Yee Haw farm in Duncannon, has always voted Democrat. She was a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. Patting her "girls" - the milk cows she tends on the 160 acres she farms - she says that she's leaning Republican."I don't trust Hillary. We've had eight years of a Hillary administration and I think we need change."She says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. "I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. Our country's in dire straits right now. We need to wake up."She expresses some misgivings about a Trump finger on the nuclear button, but doesn't think it disqualifies him from the White House.An hour south-east of Yee Haw farm, in Pennsylvania's more affluent Lancaster County, Ann Womble is rather more concerned. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa.But the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. She dismisses comparisons between the reality TV star, Donald Trump, and the Hollywood actor, Ronald Reagan, who first attracted her to the party."Reagan's candidacy was a sunny, happy conservative insurgency into the Republican Party, because it was optimistic. Now, we're in the opposite place. Trump is attracting people to his candidacy for dark, gloomy and dangerous reasons."His view is of an autocratic, almost Third World leader. If he were actually president of the United States and tweeting these things that he tweets all hours of the day, saying these things to camera, it could be apocalyptic."But, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. Although she'll support Republican candidates for Congress, she may not vote in the presidential election at all.And that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party.While disillusioned Democrats are embracing Mr Trump, disillusioned Republicans find it much harder to support his opponent. Mrs Clinton's convention may project a positive vision of America. But to really succeed it needs to address and counter the negative impression that many Americans have of her.
Mr Kenneth had denied banging on a door at his Dundee home in December during a row with his girlfriend Reagan Kelbie.Ms Kelbie told Dundee Sheriff Court during a brief trial that she had not been in a state of "fear or alarm" when Mr Kenneth was at her door.Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC found Mr Kenneth not guilty of the charge.The 29-year-old was fined Â£300 at a previous court hearing after admitting driving away without insurance after the row last December.
Students and staff at the INTO language skills centre in the Haymarket area had to leave the building on Tuesday night.A bomb disposal team performed a controlled explosion on the Town Moor in the early hours.An 18-year-old man was arrested in London. The university said the campus was now open as normal.No-one was reported injured and police said there was no danger to the public.A spokesman for Newcastle University said: "The INTO building is now open for staff and students following last night's evacuation and we are working closely with Northumbria Police with their on-going inquiries."Roads in the area reopened before 01:00 BST.A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: "Residents around Newcastle Town Moor may have heard a slight bang and I would like to reassure them this is in connection with the incident at the University and was planned."Inquiries are in the early stages and we are working closely with Newcastle University."There is currently no cause for concern for students and the wider community."Newcastle University caters for more than 22,000 UK and international students and has 1,200 academic staff.The INTO Centre offers facilities for more than 700 mainly international students and is spread over four floors.
Police arrested Reuben Stretton, 20, of no fixed address, on Friday and charged him with the murder of 20-year-old Isaac Williams.Mr Williams, who was found injured in Cropthorne Avenue, Evington, on 21 April, died in hospital on Monday.A second man, Devan Garner, 19, of Octon Close, Hamilton, Leicester, has also been charged with his murder.Charlotte Ford, 22, also of Octon Close, Hamilton, was charged with perverting the course of justice.Mr Williams has been described by friends and family as a "quiet, polite lad".Former coach Jon Whike said: "He was easy to coach, always smiling, with a big grin on his face."A tribute on the Railwaymen's Boxing Club's Facebook page said: "Rest in peace Isaac a polite talented young man - our thoughts are with family and friends."
The figures for the Walmart-owned supermarket, filed at Companies House, confirm a torrid spell for Asda as it faced stiff competition in the grocery sector.Like-for-like sales were down 5.7% compared with the previous year.Pre-tax profits dropped almost 19% to Â£791.7m at the Leeds-based company."The grocery market has continued to experience low growth throughout the year and competition in the sector has remained intense. Our sales performance, relative to the market, was behind our expectations," the company said.Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - the so-called big four UK supermarkets - also face competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl.Asda suffered more than most and, unlike others, has struggled to fight back. In May, it reported decreasing sales in the first quarter of 2017 - the 11th consecutive quarter of falls - as it continued to lose ground to its rivals.However, Asda added that despite the disappointing results, there had been an improvement following "strategic changes" under new boss Sean Clarke.Mr Clarke, who replaced previous chief executive Andy Clarke a year ago, has slashed the prices of everyday items as he attempts to arrest falling sales.The chain reported a 2.8% fall in like-for-like sales in its first quarter of this year, a moderate improvement on the previous period, which saw sales fall 2.9%.Analysts have said that a major turnaround is required at Asda."Sainsbury's and Tesco have always had more opportunity for differentiation from the discounters, but Asda has chosen to focus on price rather than range and in-store experience, which has clearly been the wrong strategy," said Tom Berry, retail analyst at GlobalData."Asda has been flailing without direction for too long, and a comprehensive plan is needed if it is to survive in the highly competitive UK grocery market."Phil Dorrell, of consultancy Retail Remedy, is a previous marketing chief at Asda. He said that it was a difficult market for Asda and it "had a lot of catching up to do"."It is not changing significantly or fast enough to pull around the results. It did not get its proposition right," he said.
Five guards are also missing and are believed to have aided the mass prison breakout in Nuevo Laredo town.Mexican police say the majority of those on the run are drug traffickers and members of armed gangs.The prison system is struggling to cope with an influx of offenders arrested in a campaign against drugs cartels.Correspondents say prison breakouts are not uncommon in northern Mexico, where more than 400 inmates have escaped since January 2010.Nuevo Laredo, in Tamaulipas state, lies just across the border from Laredo, Texas.The largest jail break so far was last December when more than 140 prisoners escaped from the same prison.According to a statement from the Tamaulipas state government, the riot began on Friday morning in Nuevo Laredo's Sanctions Enforcement Centre, which houses an estimated 1,200 prisoners.After the breakout, soldiers surrounded the jail and calm was restored, the authorities said.The northern border region is the scene of rising lawlessness as the cartels fight the security forces and each other for control of smuggling routes into the US.The main battle in Tamaulipas is between the Zetas and the Gulf cartels, the AFP news agency reports.Their capacity for violence and ability to pay huge bribes gives them considerable power to subvert the prison system and get their people out.President Felipe Calderon came to power in 2006 promising a war on drugs.More than 35,000 people have died in drug violence since he began his campaign, which has involved launching an army assault on drug gangs.
The play, written by Jack Thorne, is set 19 years after the seventh and final book in the series by JK Rowling.It opens officially at the Palace Theatre, in London's West End, on Saturday.Audiences have been urged to "keep the secrets" since the play began previews in early June.Presented in two parts, the play - showing the stars of the wizarding saga as adults in their mid-30s as their own children head off to school - stretches over five hours.Daily Telegraph critic Dominic Cavendish awarded the play five stars, writing: "British theatre hasn't known anything like it for decades and I haven't seen anything directly comparable in all my reviewing days."He said "those involved can give themselves a pat on the back", adding: "It's a triumph. Not an unqualified one - there are some quibbles - but in all key respects, it grips, it stirs, it delights."Cavendish praises the "thrill-a-minute" stage craft which sees pupils heading to Hogwarts, at the start of the play, change into school uniforms "in the blink of an eye" as they head to the infamous Platform 9Â¾ to make their way to school.The Stage also gives a five-star review, with Mark Shenton describing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - co-devised by Rowling, with director John Tiffany and playwright Jack Thorne - as a "truly game-changing production and a thrilling theatrical endeavour".It is an "entirely original" piece of work, with "Dickensian sweep and momentum to the storytelling", writes Shenton, adding: "It earns its place on the stage, feeling distinct from both the books and the screen adaptations."By turns playful and gripping, disturbing and detailed, poignant and powerful, it is superb family entertainment."Shenton also praises "the theatrical wizards who've created this stunningly-realised alternative universe deliver one coup de theatre after another".In a nod to the Kings Cross platform number, Ann Treneman gives the play four and three-quarters stars in The Times, saying the "wizardry on display" is "out of this world".She says the plot is complex ("there are mazes that are more straightforward") but adds: "It's a raunchless Game of Thrones with heart. Crucially, it's authentic Potter but, most importantly, it's new."It's not the movie of the book. It's the real deal, live in front of you, so much better than any film could be."In The Guardian, Michael Billington noted the Cursed Child will make more sense to "hardened Potterheads", but applauded Tiffany for directing a "thrilling theatrical spectacle", giving it four stars.He praised the strong performances that meant acting was central to the story, despite the dazzling special effects, singling out Sam Clemmett as Harry's son Albus, "wonderfully quirky" Anthony Boyle as his friend Scorpius Malfoy, and the adult Harry (Jamie Parker), "authoritative" Hermione (Noma Dumezweni) and "bluntly commonsensical" Ron (Paul Thornley).It's another five stars from The Independent, with Jack Shepherd describing it as "magical". He argues Part One should be billed as a magic show, due to the effects used, also praising its moments of comedy.Shepherd adds: "It's quite apparent this isn't written to be either a book or a tie-in film; it's a spectacle for the theatre, one that is filled to the brim with fan service and magical imagery that will amaze."Quentin Letts grumbles about the length of the play in the Daily Mail, noting: "There were moments I could have done with a glug of gurdyroot infusion to keep me alert."But he admits: "Potter addicts will love it. JK Rowling is going to make (another) fortune. The West End's ornate Palace Theatre, itself a little like Hogwarts, has a hit probably for years."Variety describes it as "spellbinding", Matt Trueman writing that it is: "The Show That Lived Up to Expectations â€” and Then Some."He says the relationship between Albus and Scorpius is "the friendship of two bullied boys bound together, and it's a beautiful, tender thing", adding: "The script by Jack Thorne recognizes that rejection breeds resentment, and outsiders stew into outcasts."No one's born a villain, nor sees themselves as such, and where the books gave us stock baddies, Cursed Child fleshes them out."Chris Jones, in the Chicago Tribune, says that "heretical as this may sound", the play left him "quietly lamenting that the movies were ever made".Ben Brantley in the New York Times writes: "Like the novels that preceded it, The Cursed Child is stuffed with arcana-filled plots that defy diagrams and baldly wrought sentimental life lessons, along with anguished dives into the earnest, tortured solipsism of adolescence."By rights, such a combination should try the patience of any grown-up. But like Ms Rowling's books, the play vanquishes resistance."The Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since 1997 and been adapted into eight films.The script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is published this weekend.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
There were celebrations in Europe after Germany surrendered.But on the other side of the world in the Pacific Ocean, Japan was still fighting against America, Britain and their allies.The Americans, however, had a secret plan to end the war - by using the most powerful weapon ever created.On 6 August 1945, at 8.15am Japanese time, an American B-29 bomber plane, called 'Enola Gay', dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.The devastation was beyond anything seen before. The city was immediately flattened.80,000 people were killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 were injured.Even then, Japan didn't surrender.Three days later, another nuclear bomb was dropped by the Americans on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.Shortly afterwards, on 15 August 1945, Japan finally admitted defeat.World War Two was over.When the bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the city has struck by a flash of blinding light then a giant cloud shaped like a mushroom.The blast flattened buildings within a 2.5 km radius of the bomb.There were 90,000 buildings in Hiroshima before the bomb was dropped but only 28,000 remained after the explosion.Thousands and thousands of people were killed.  Many were badly injured.But the suffering didn't end there because it wasn't just a normal bomb.The nuclear radiation released when it exploded caused people to suffer horrible illnesses.Thousands more people died from their injuries and radiation sickness in the weeks, months and years that followed.Japan was at war with America and its allies, which included Britain and Soviet Union (a nation made up of modern-day Russia and other countries).The allies were winning the war and the Japanese forces had been pushed back from many locations.However fighting was still very fierce and soldiers and civilians were dying every day.Japan had been at war for many years.It had invaded the countries near to it such as China and the Japanese had attacked America.Everywhere the Japanese soldiers went, they were known for their cruelty.They treated prisoners of war very badly, including  American and British soldiers who had surrendered.US President Harry S Truman wanted the Japanese to surrender as quickly as possible so he could save lives.The atomic bomb was a deadly new weapon.President Truman hoped the massive destruction it caused would shock the Japanese into realising they had to surrender.US President Truman wanted to avoid a land invasion of Japan.There were 2.5 million Japanese troops stationed there and Truman's staff estimated that defeating them would cost the lives of 250,000 US soldiers.Some historians also say that the US wanted to avoid Japan being occupied by Soviet troops.America and the Soviet Union were allies but they did not really trust each other.It was the first and only time that atomic bombs have been used in a war.Although the scientists who made the bombs were proud of what they'd achieved, it scared them as well.The way the atomic bomb was built meant it had huge power - enough to destroy whole cities on it's own.Many people now believe that the devastation caused in Hiroshima, and in Nagasaki, was so awful that the bombs should never be used again.Today, a small number of countries around the world, including USA, China and the UK, have nuclear weapons.Some campaigners argue that there is no place for nuclear weapons and that all countries should get rid of them immediately.Others say that having such terrible weapons will keep a country safe, even if they are never used.
Alistair Fitt, vice chancellor of Oxford Brookes, was giving evidence to the Education Select Committee, holding a special away-day session at the University of Oxford.With the elegant panorama of Pembroke College behind them, the MPs wanted to find out what would be the impact of Brexit on the UK's university sector.You would be hard-pressed to find any sector in the country more opposed to Brexit than higher education.So it was probably no surprise that the MPs heard an unrelenting message that leaving the EU was a grim prospect for higher education and research.University organisations, which usually put much effort and ingenuity into not really being for or against anything in public, took to open campaigning for a Remain vote.Universities, bastions of liberal thinking, intensely international in their outlook and staffing, seemed culturally allergic to Brexit.And the referendum result hangs over them like they've fought and lost a civil war.Professor Catherine Barnard from the University of Cambridge told MPs that her own university had seen a 14% drop in applications this year from EU students.The university had asked why potential students had turned down a chance to study at Cambridge - and she said among the reasons were fears over an "anti-immigrant sentiment" and uncertainty over the future of the UK's involvement in international research.Prof Barnard warned that talented mathematicians at Cambridge from countries such as Hungary, Poland and Romania would take their sought-after skills elsewhere.The committee of MPs heard warnings that in some elite research institutions in the UK, vital to the national infrastructure, as many as two thirds of the staff were EU nationals from outside the UK.Would they hang around and see if they were still wanted after Brexit? Or would research rivals in Germany or China snap them up to the detriment of the UK economy?Showing how seriously they take this, Oxford University has appointed its own head of Brexit strategy.So you could say that at least Brexit has already created one extra job.But this new postholder, Professor Alistair Buchan, saw leaving the EU as threatening to relegate the UK's universities behind their global competition.Oxford has been ranked as the world's top university, but Prof Buchan said that in 1970s the UK's universities did not have that top status. This had been built through the EU years and growing networks of international partnerships.He described Brexit for universities as the "Manchester United problem".Why would any football team with international ambitions deliberately want to restrict its access both to better talent and to bigger markets?There were warnings about the financial impact of losing European research funding.The UK's universities are among the biggest winners from Horizon 2020 research network, bringing more than Â£2bn into the higher education sector.This is no small-biÃ¨re, with some individual universities worrying about the loss of hundreds of millions.If the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some "serious funding".Professor Stephanie Haywood, president of the Engineering Professors' Council, warned that losing access to EU students would make skills shortages in engineering even worse.But could there be an upside in higher tuition fees?If EU students are designated as overseas students after Brexit, UK universities could charge them much higher fees.But such a tuition fee windfall depends on those students not staying at home or going somewhere else.Prof Barnard raised the example of those talented eastern European mathematicians.Would they really be able to pay Â£17,000 or so a year? Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere?Committee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts.But what came back most often was even more questions. What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will be the visa system for students?What will happen to the intricate networks of European research? How much will the UK government be willing to cover for any lost income?And of course, so far, these are unknowns being piled up on unknowables.But as another European refugee scientist, Albert Einstein, once said: "If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research."
Six men and two women were killed when the minibus they were in collided with two lorries near Milton Keynes.Ryszard Masierak, 31, and David Wagstaff, 53, have been charged with eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving.The first victim has been identified as minibus owner Cyriac Joseph, 52.Wipro, an IT services company, said three of its employees were also among those who died, and a fourth staff member had been critically injured."It is with deep regret and sadness that we confirm the passing away of three of our colleagues, Karthikeyan Ramasubramaniyam Pugalur, Rishi Rajeev Kumar, and Vivek Bhaskaran in a tragic road accident in the UK," a spokesman for the firm said."Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who lost their lives in this tragedy."It is understood the men were all contracted to work in Nottingham.A service was held in memory of Mr Joseph on Sunday at St Paul's Church, Lenton, Nottingham.Father Biju Joseph, who conducted the Mass, confirmed Mr Joseph's wife and children, a 19-year-old man and girl aged 15, who attended the service, were told of his death by police on Saturday morning.He said the prayer service was a "great relief" for them."It's so sad and we're praying to God for his soul and his family," he said. "People are really shocked, he was such a good friend. He was like a brother to me."Alex Daniel, a friend, said Mr Joseph was a "great leader" within the south Indian community in Nottingham.He said: "I'm not surprised by the amount of people who came here [to the service]. We got calls from across the country showing concerns for the family."A five-year-old girl, a man and a woman were left with life-threatening injuries in the crash, and are still critically ill in hospital. Another woman has serious injuries.Thames Valley Police said the vehicles were all travelling in the same direction southbound between junctions 15 and 14 at Newport Pagnell at about 03:15 BST on Saturday.Some of those on board the minibus, which carried branding for the Nottingham-based firm ABC Travels, were visiting the UK from India, police said.Friends of Mr Joseph, who was also known as Benny and originally came from the Indian state of Kerala, paid tribute on social media."My dearest friend Benny passed away this morning after a huge road accident happened in M1 in London," said Soyimon Joseph in a Facebook post."Hearty condolences. I never thought yesterday 10pm you say thank you to me it was our last meeting."Another Facebook tribute read: "Words cannot describe how helpful you are. You are there when we need you. You are my big brother."My deepest and sincere condolences to my best friend Cyriac Joseph (Benny)," wrote Manu Zachariah.Thames Valley Police said the two men charged in connection with the crash also each faced four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.Mr Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, was additionally charged with eight counts of causing death by careless driving while over the drink-drive limit.He will appear at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court on Monday.Mr Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, is due before Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court on 11 September.Pictures of the vehicles showed significant damage to the two lorries, which appeared to belong to courier firm FedEx and AIM Logistics.Spokesmen for the two companies expressed sympathies to those who lost loved ones in the crash, and said the companies were assisting police with their inquiries.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning
The UK is holding its breath, waiting for the results in the coming weeks of the long-delayed Chilcot enquiry into those events.It is also agonising over whether to join the Americans and others in extending its bombing campaign  from Iraq to Syria against the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), whose rise is widely seen as a consequence of the 2003 invasion and the ensuing upheavals.Since the outset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Americans and their Western partners have been mesmerised by the chaos in Iraq as an object lesson for how not to deal with Syria.That is the overriding reason why they have long tiptoed around the prospect of embroilment in the Syrian affair.US President Barack Obama was elected specifically on a platform of ending such foreign adventures, not getting caught in yet another one.It was only with extreme reluctance that he found himself drawn into the air campaigns against IS in both Iraq and Syria, with limited and cautious engagement of advisers and special forces on the ground.It was all very different back in 2002 and 2003, when the neo-conservatives then in the ascendant in Washington were looking for any pretext to move against Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein, as part of a broader ambition to shape a "new Middle East".Ahmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, at that time headed the umbrella opposition grouping in exile called the Iraqi National Council (INC).Viscerally dedicated to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Chalabi found himself point man for an opposition effort to persuade the Americans to invade and rid the country of the feared dictator, having despaired of other methods such as trying to engineer an internal coup.He found himself knocking on an open door.If he knowingly misled Washington with dodgy intelligence on Saddam's non-existent weapons of mass destruction and links with international terrorism, he knew that powerful American circles were willingly taking the bait without scrutiny as they prepared for their war of choice.They were using him, and he was using them.With the Chilcot conclusions looming, Tony Blair, who led the UK into the Iraq war alongside the Americans, came out recently in a CNN interview with a qualified apology for the fact that the intelligence on which the invasion was based was false and that insufficient thought had been given to what should happen next.But Chalabi entertained no such misgivings. In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.But it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.In the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.Thousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.IS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.Now it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.That is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.Doing nothing may increasingly not be an option. But the fate of Iraq since 2003 underscores the potentially disastrous dangers of ill-conceived meddling.
Jamaica's quartet clocked 36.84 seconds, smashing the old mark by two-tenths of a second and leaving the United States with silver.Nesta Carter and Michael Frater produced excellent first and second legs but it was 100m and 200m silver medallist Yohan Blake's blistering third leg that set the platform.Bolt provided the perfect finale - exploding away to leave Ryan Bailey trailing as the capacity crowd stood to acclaim him.Canada were initially given bronze before being disqualified when third-leg runner Jared Connaughton stepped outside of his lane, meaning Trinidad and Tobago were promoted to third place.After winning the  and  in Beijing 2008 and London 2012, plus the 4x100m relay, the latest gold means Bolt now has six Olympic golds before his 26th birthday."It was electric. The atmosphere in the stadium was electric and it was all because of this race. The big difference was when Blake received the baton he tore around the bend - and he was up against Tyson Gay! Usain Bolt was watching that clock all the way down the home straight."It was a fitting way to conclude a wonderful nine days of athletics in the Olympic Stadium.Bolt said London 2012 had been "amazing" and on the race added: "It's a wonderful feeling to end on a high note. It was a great championships, I'm happy, the team came out and gave it their all, I wish we could have gone faster but we leave room for improvement."He said he did not know if he would be aiming for a third treble gold haul in Rio 2016: "It's going to be hard. Yohan is running hard and I'm sure there's going to be more young cats coming up."Usain Bolt celebrated with a "Mobot" as he crossed the line, paying tribute to Britain's 5,000m and 10,000m double Olympic champion, Mo Farah.
"It would be a fundamental forward step for Wales," said South and Mid Wales Chambers of Commerce president Liz Maher.Meanwhile, a business confidence plan and a £5m jobs and growth fund have been announced by First Minister Carwyn Jones, as a response to Brexit.He hosted an extraordinary meeting of the Council for Economic Renewal.It brought together business leaders, the TUC and senior politicians to discuss the impact of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.It was set-up in response to the financial crisis and meets around three times a year.This was thought to be its first extraordinary meeting.Prime Minister Theresa May has already met with Mr Jones and says Wales and the other devolved nations will have a role to play in negotiations.The first minister said the Welsh Government wanted to assure businesses and inward investors that Wales remains open for business."The EU referendum result has created uncertainty and instability which can damage business confidence and have a longer-term impact on jobs and investment," he said.Mr Jones is allocating £5m to the new Growth and Prosperity Fund to ensure the economy continued to grow and Wales continued to be an attractive destination for investment."These actions will support Welsh businesses looking to grow and increase the number and scale of Welsh-based companies that are exporting," he said."We will also be engaging with businesses about how we can support them and promoting Wales with potential inward investors."Ms Maher said EU funding and the labour skills gap, which would influence future immigration policy, were some of the issues which needed answering in Wales."There's such a long way to go but there are opportunities there," said Ms Maher.She said as well as stability for the economy there needed to be action and the taskforce would bring together the "huge amount of experience" and specialist knowledge from business.The business confidence plan - outlined by Economy and Infrastructure Secretary Ken Skates - includes discussing what support Finance Wales could bring and also bringing forward a plan for export support.The Welsh Government is also planning an all-age apprenticeship programme and a campaign to support tourist businesses.Details on how to apply to the Growth and Prosperity Fund will be available shortly.The leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies called for a "spirit of conciliation".He said: "Today's calls for a taskforce to deal with Brexit are sensible, but the first minister needs to reach out to people from both sides of the referendum campaign."Brexit presents Wales with significant opportunities and poses questions that could be best answered by a diverse range of voices - not just a chorus of politicians who opposed leaving the EU."
The poll of 1,650 Britons by YouGov found 56% would quit the competition.And it found those who backed Leave in the EU referendum were most likely to want to drop out, with 76% to 21% in favour of quitting. Remain voters were 65% to 35% in favour of competing.The UK first entered Eurovision in the second year of the contest in 1957 and has won five times - the last in 1997.That victory for Katrina and the Waves with Love, Shine a Light, followed wins by Sandie Shaw (Puppet on a String, 1967), Lulu (Boom Bang-a-Bang, 1969), Brotherhood of Man (Save Your Kisses for Me, 1976) and Bucks Fizz (Making Your Mind Up, 1981).However, since 1997 the UK has finished last three times - in 2003, 2008 and 2010 - and has failed to make it into the top 10 for the past seven years.This year's contest will take place in Kiev on Saturday, following Jamala's win for Ukraine last year singing 1944.The UK will be represented by former X Factor contestant Lucie Jones, who will sing her ballad Never Give Up On You, but according to YouGov only a fifth of Britons (22%) are intending to watch the show.Of those planning to watch, 26% of people said their reason for watching was the "amusing commentary", which will again be provided by Graham Norton, 19% are planning to make fun of the show and just 9% say they tune in because they like the music.
US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Americans will leave RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk and RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire.The move is part of a programme to save £320m ($500m) a year across Europe. The USAF lease the RAF bases.Mr Hagel said he understood it would mean job losses and thanked those who had supported the US Air Force."I know that this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations; I value the tremendous support they provided us for decades."The USAF KC-135 tanker fleet based at Mildenhall will be moved to Germany.RAF Lakenheath, with two squadrons of new F-35 jets (48 of them) arriving by 2020, will be the aircraft's only European base.The Pentagon said the loss of about 2,000 US military and civilian personnel is due to relocation away from Mildenhall, but will be offset by the addition of about 1,200 people stationed permanently at Lakenheath.Matthew Hancock, West Suffolk MP and Minister of State for Business, Enterprise and Energy, said he would support the community affected.Mildenhall had a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force and the move "will come as a shock to many", he said."I have met with the defence secretary, and others in government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community."We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs [local enterprise partnerships], councils, the Ministry of Defence and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area."A UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "The US Department of Defence (DoD) has been reviewing its requirement for bases across Europe as part of (its) European infrastructure consolidation review."RAF Mildenhall is used as a transport hub by the USAF and is home to air refuelling tankers and special operations forces.It has about 3,200 military personnel, with 400-500 UK civilian staff employed there.Both bases are in the Forest Heath District Council area.James Waters, leader of the council, said: "The USAF contributes significantly to the local economy so the expansion of RAF Lakenheath, and with it the US government's commitment to the site as part of its long term plans, is very welcome."But this happiness is obviously tempered by our sadness that Mildenhall is to close."Both announcements mean huge changes to the landscape of Forest Heath , but I am optimistic that with every change there are opportunities for reinvention, growth and investment."For some years now the US military has been reviewing its bases in Europe, eager to reduce its footprint to rationalise and cut costs.In part it is due to budget constraints but it is also driven by strategic changes as the Pentagon turns its gaze increasingly towards the Asia-Pacific.RAF Mildenhall has been an important base for the Americans since the early 1950s when it was home to strategic bombers.Currently it houses US Air Force Special Forces and a fleet of air-to-air tankers.The latter, though less glamorous than fast jets, are some of the most important elements of the USAF, described by one analyst as the "kryptonite" of modern air power.They enable combat and support aircraft to reach their targets and to remain over combat zones for the time needed to carry out their missions.It is likely that the KC-135 tankers from Mildenhall will move to a US base in Germany.British defence sources are eager to stress that the base closures here - two US-run communications stations at RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth in Cambridgeshire are also to shut down  - do not represent any dilution of Washington's commitment to European security.Indeed RAF Lakenheath is due to host two squadrons of new F-35 aircraft when they enter service.Over recent months the Americans have deployed small but significant reinforcements to Europe to reassure NATO allies like Poland and the Baltic republics in the wake of Russia's actions against Ukraine.The US had hundreds of tanks in Europe during Cold War but there was a brief moment after 2013 when all US tanks had been withdrawn from Europe.Today about a battalion's worth are back in Europe exercising with allies.But the Pentagon has plans to store an armoured brigade's worth of equipment - some 150 tanks along with other armoured vehicles  - in Europe by 2015.RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth are used as USAF communications bases, rather than for flying, and their operations were expected to move to RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.The USAF has about 750 military personnel at the two Cambridgeshire bases, with a further 1,500 civilian employees and dependents.Jason Ablewhite, leader of Huntingdonshire District Council, said the news was "hugely disappointing" as both bases contributed about £40m a year to the local economy.He said it would mean the loss of 760 personnel and 1,500 civilian jobs, adding: "The impact on the local economy could be considerable."However, the Enterprise Zone is on the same site as RAF Alconbury, and will provide thousands of jobs over the coming years."
Ms Borst, 81, helped push through legislation in 2001 that made the Netherlands the first country to legalise euthanasia.Forensic scientists were unable to say why she died. Police have said it was either an accident or a crime.Ms Borst, who was a medical academic, served as minister from 1994-2002.Her body was found on Monday evening and the area around her home near the central city of Utrecht was cordoned off.Initial inquiries proved inconclusive, however police on Tuesday ruled out death by natural causes.A full post mortem examination will now take place at the Netherlands Forensic Institute, they say."She may have had an accident after she felt unwell, but that cannot yet be said with certainty," a police spokesman told Dutch media. "So we cannot yet say whether any crime may have been involved."A spokesman had earlier told Dutch radio there were no indications of anything untoward happening.Els Borst had appeared at a conference of her liberal D66 party on Saturday and her death came as a shock to political colleagues in The Hague.For a time, she led her party in the 1990s and Prime Minister Mark Rutte said her death was a great loss for Dutch politics."She ensured a breakthrough in the field of euthanasia for which very many people are still grateful," said Health Minister Edith Schippers.She was also behind legislation governing the use of tissue from aborted foetuses for medical research.
Antony Ricketts, 20, was also ordered to pay costs of £186.31 after being convicted in his absence in Carmarthen.He was also found guilty of putting non-recyclable waste out in blue bags in Barnsfield Terrace."Bags of rubbish left littering the streets for days on end will not be tolerated," said Councillor Jim Jones, environment executive member.Ricketts must also pay a victim surcharge of £20 after the conviction under the Environmental Protection Act.Ricketts was warned by council officers, but problems continued and they found evidence linking him to black bags and contaminated blue recycling bags on several occasions.Two people from Llanelli have already been fined £100 after Carmarthenshire Council announced it was getting tough with householders who put out waste on the wrong day.Mr Jones added: "If a resident continually ignores the council's advice we have no choice but to issue a fine or prosecute them in court."I hope residents take notice of this case and act responsibly to reduce the amount of rubbish littering our streets."
Redcar's RNLI lifeboat was called to East Scar rocks in Saltburn on Saturday when three teenagers became stranded.A spokesman said it was the latest in a spate of incidents in the area, with 18 people rescued so far this year.Redcar and Cleveland Council has now said it will put additional signage on the beach, warning of the danger.
Mr Bannon, formerly the head of the populist right-wing, Breitbart News website, will join high-level discussions about national security.The order was signed on Saturday.The director of national intelligence and the joint chiefs will attend when discussions pertain to their areas.Under previous administrations, the director and joint chiefs attended all meetings of the NSC's inner circle, the principals' committee.The National Security Council (NSC) is the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs.It is led by retired lieutenant-general Mike Flynn, who was one of Mr Trump's closest advisers and most ardent supporters during the campaign."The security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries," Mr Trump's executive order said."Accordingly, the United States Government's decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative."Last week, Mr Bannon described the US mainstream media as "the opposition party", saying it should "keep its mouth shut".The site he once managed, Breitbart News, serves up an anti-establishment agenda that critics accuse of xenophobia and misogyny. Under Mr Bannon, it became one of the most-read conservative news and opinion sites in the US.Mr Trump also ordered a restructuring of the Homeland Security Council.In two separate measures, the president ordered:
Jean Jeanie, an eight-year-old Dexter cow, was "adopted" by Derbyshire woman Trisha Boyko who "fell in love" with her after walking past her field.But struggling to meet costs, Ms Boyko raised ??3,500 online and called her "the people's cow".Now Cornish accountant Martin Sands, who saw the news story, has agreed to pay ??65 a month for ongoing keep.Mr Sands said it was "not a normal thing" for him to sponsor a cow as he did not have a particular interest in animals.But he said Jean Jeanie was "a really beautiful cow" and he was overwhelmed by her story."Some of her sponsors had promised income for 12 months and then dropped out, so I promised to fund her for 12 months - probably longer."The cow was spotted alone in a field by Ms Boyko who, after hearing she might be destined for market, purchased the animal.The 52-year-old made a Facebook page for Jean, short for the cow's registered name of Mooridge Jeanie, which attracted donations."She lit my days up and I'd like to think I cheered her up. She's got a lovely character, she's really gentle, she's lovely."She is the people's cow," she added.Ms Boyko said on her Facebook page that Jeanie and her Cornish sponsor got along well: "I am pleased to say he was most impressed to meet the beautiful Jean and she was on her best behaviour."She added the cow was "so much better than this time last year - what a difference a year makes".

The CIES Football Observatory has drawn up a list of the players with most league appearances by year of birth.It says 19-year-old Alli's 98 games for Spurs and MK Dons are the most for a player born in 1996 or later.The list is dominated by Premier League players ahead of their rivals in Spain, Germany, Italy and France.England international Alli has made one more appearance than Barcelona's Croatia Under-21 international Alen Halolovic, 19, who is on loan at Sporting Gijon. Third on the list is Villarreal's Spain U21 international winger Matias Nahuel, 19.Among players born in 1985 or later, only one player has more games under his belt than Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney - Bournemouth defender Simon Francis with 460 games.Everton's Romelu Lukaku, 22, tops the list for players born after 1993, having played 210 games so far for the Toffees, Anderlecht, Chelsea and West Brom.Of players born after 1991, Chelsea's Eden Hazard has played 277 games, just ahead of Liverpool's Nathaniel Clyne.Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink has urged doctors at the Football Association and Premier League clubs to put pressure on the game's authorities to reduce the number of fixtures played by clubs in English competitions.Chelsea face four games in the next 12 days across three competitions, and Hiddink says the players need more protection.But former Chelsea doctor Ralph Rogers told BBC Radio 5 live on Monday that was unrealistic."I appreciate his concern but it's all market-driven. People want football," he said.

The woman, 24, stopped breathing during a procedure at a clinic in Bangkok on Thursday, an official said.A doctor, Sompob Sansiri, has been charged with recklessly causing the woman's death and bailed, police said.The Foreign Office said it had been informed of the death and was "ready to provide consular assistance".The patient, who has not been named, was having minor corrective surgery to her back after a previous operation, officers said.The director general of Thailand's health service support department, Boonruang Triruangworawat, said attempts had been made to revive the woman when she stopped breathing.She was under anaesthesia when she died, Thai police said.The Thai Ministry of Health said it would file a charge of operating an unlicensed clinic because the facility was not licensed to operate at night.The SP Clinic has been shut down for 60 days while the death is investigated.
Rebels fired rocket launchers on an army post in Hakkari province just after midnight, NTV in Turkey said.Military jets are pursuing them and bombing their escape routes, NTV said.The interior minister says at least 115 rebels have been killed in a large-scale military offensive in the area in the last two weeks.Idris Naim Sahin said the offensive close to Semdinli town - also in Hakkari province - was ongoing and that troops were taking steps to prevent rebels fleeing into northern Iraq.The offensive is one of the biggest in years, with NTV reporting that about 2,000 troops are involved.Several thousand Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels are believed to be based in hideouts in northern Iraq.According to the governor for Hakkari province, Orhan Alimoglu, six soldiers, two village guards and 11 Kurdish rebels were killed in the attack near the village of Gecimili.He said 15 soldiers were injured in the incident.The number of clashes between the PKK and the Turkish armed forces has risen in south-east Turkey over the past year.A series of clashes in June left dozens dead.The PKK is classified as a terrorist organisation by the EU and the US.It launched a guerrilla campaign in 1984 for an ethnic homeland in the Kurdish heartland in the south-east of Turkey.It has now dropped its claim to an independent Kurdish state, but says it is fighting for autonomy and the cultural rights of the Kurdish people.

His was not the only voice warning of the dangers of AI - Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak also expressed their concerns about where the technology was heading - though Professor Hawking's was the most apocalyptic vision of a world where robots decide they don't need us any more.What all of these prophets of AI doom wanted to do was to get the world thinking about where the science was heading - and make sure other voices joined the scientists in that debate.That they have achieved that aim was evident on Wednesday night at an event in Cambridge marking the opening of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, designed to do some of that thinking about the implications of AI.And Professor Hawking was there to help launch the centre. "I'm glad someone was listening," he told the audience.In a short speech, he outlined the potential and the pitfalls of the technology in his usual vivid language.  He reviewed the recent rapid progress in areas like self-driving cars and the triumph of Google's DeepMind in the game of Go - and predicted further advances."I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.  It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence â€” and exceed it."That, he said, could lead to the eradication of disease and poverty and the conquest of climate change. But it could also bring us all sorts of things we didn't like - autonomous weapons, economic disruption  and machines that developed a will of their own, in conflict with humanity."In short, the rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity.  We do not yet know which."So, an easy enough mission for the Centre for the Study of Intelligence - just find out whether AI is going to kill us or not.Actually the multi-disciplinary centre,  which brings together philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists,  will have a rather more practical programme of research.Long before the robots decide whether we are surplus to requirements,  we are for instance going to need to think about issues such as whether autonomous vehicles should be programmed to protect pedestrians or passengers.Another speaker at the event was Professor Maggie Boden, a major figure in artificial intelligence research for more than 50 years.She told me she had long seen the need for the debate we are having now - but she was not worrying about our imminent extinction and was rather less convinced than Professor Hawking that we were heading into the AI future at breakneck speed.Her concern was about the impact of automation right now - in Japan at least - on elderly people.  She pointed to the enthusiasm for the use of robots in the care of the elderly and sick and said society would have to ask whether this was dehumanising. "I'm scared of that," she said.After decades of research into AI,  Professor Boden still does not see robots replacing humans in functions which require empathy and emotional intelligence. Artificial intelligence could soon offer governments the chance to cut growing bills for social care - but at a cost for those in need of  help.Just one of the issues which will now be addressed by the Centre for the Future of Intelligence - and rather more urgent than the threat from some future Terminator.Read more of the BBC's AI coverage here.
PC David Rathband was blinded by Moat in Newcastle on 4 July, 2010 and took his own life in February 2012.His twin brother Darren said the family were "still fighting for acknowledgement that David was let down" by Northumbria Police.The force said the family's legal case against it would go to court in 2016.Family members claim Northumbria Police did not do enough to warn staff that Moat had told a 999 call handler he was hunting for officers on the night of the shooting. The force denies this.Traffic officer PC Rathband was finishing his shift in a marked patrol car when he was shot twice by a shotgun fired by Moat.He survived but lost his sight in both eyes.Moat had shot Samantha Stobbart, who survived, and Chris Brown, who died, in Birtley, Gateshead, the previous day hours after his release from prison.Following a week on the run, the former nightclub bouncer turned the gun on himself during a stand-off with police in Rothbury on 10 July.After he was shot, PC Rathband founded the Blue Lamp Foundation to help injured 999 workers, wrote a book about his experiences and became a national figure.However, he struggled to cope with the consequences of losing his sight and the father-of-two, 44, killed himself at his home in Blyth, Northumberland.His brother, who lives in Australia, said of the 4 July anniversary of the shooting: "As a family we obviously reflect on past events that had such a tragic outcome for David."It means we understand more than most the risks the emergency services, especially police, are asked to face on a daily basis."He said the dangers faced by officers from acts of terror was "very pertinent" following attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait."Sadly, David will not be the last police officer injured in the line of duty; three officers have been shot and numerous have been hurt in the UK since 2010," he said.He said 4 July was a important date for the family, but that the "significant anniversary" was the date of PC Rathband's death when they lost a "very special man".
The attack happened at a house on Phibsboro Road at about 22:30 local time on Saturday night.The man was taken to the Mater Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.A woman in her 40s was arrested in connection with the incident.
The search giant has launched a series of legal actions against the London-based firm in California, claiming four of its patents have been violated, and has also filed a separate case in the UK.BT had been expecting such action after it launched its own case against Google in 2011.That dispute has yet to be resolved."We have always seen litigation as a last resort, and we work hard to avoid lawsuits," said a spokeswoman for Google."But BT has brought several meritless patent claims against Google and our customers - and they've also been arming patent trolls."The term "patent troll" describes firms that acquire patents so that they can later extract settlements from companies on infringement claims.In 2012, New Jersey-based intellectual property owner Suffolk Technologies sued Google and US internet service provider AOL over two patents it had acquired from BT.In addition, Steelhead Licensing - another firm which owns patents but does not produce products of its own - has filed a case against 14 handset makers and mobile networks, including Google's Motorola unit, claiming infringement of a wireless technology which used to be owned by BT.A spokesman for the British firm said it did not comment on pending litigation.Google has struck back with claims that BT has infringed a method to allow PCs to use an internet-based telephone system based on a patent originally filed by Fujitsu.And it says BT failed to license a system used to let computer servers prioritise data - an IBM invention now owned by the search firm.Patent consultant Florian Mueller said this was the first clear case of Google suing another company over its patents.Previous cases involving Motorola were filed ahead of Google buying the Razr handset maker.BT and Google are next set to meet in court in Delaware in July for a mediation hearing about the 2011 case.

The hosts led 21-0 after 22 minutes, with Matt Smith, Lachlan McCaffrey and Owen Williams all touching down.Tries from Teimana Harrison, George North and Jamie Gibson wrestled Saints back into it, before Burns and Stephen Myler traded kicks to make it 27-27.But Tigers, boosted by the return of Manu Tuilagi, stole it at the death.England centre Tuilagi, who ended speculation linking him with a move away from Leicester by signing a new contract last month, had not played since October 2014 because of an ongoing groin problem.But the 24-year-old came on for the final 29 minutes against Northampton, demonstrating his trademark physicality as Leicester eventually broke their resistance with the final kick of the game.Richard Cockerill's side, comfortably beaten by Saracens last week, had looked to be cruising to victory when tries from Smith, McCaffrey and Williams, who was later taken off with a suspected broken jaw, put them in command after a dominant opening quarter.But Harrison's score following a line-out catch-and-drive moments before half-time gave Saints hope, and North ran from deep inside his own half to drag them to within four points early in the second period.Shortly after Northampton had a further try through Paul Hill ruled out for a high tackle, two Burns penalties stretched Leicester's lead back to 10 points - only for Gibson's touchdown against his former club and Myler's penalty with five minutes to go to leave the scores tied.However, Burns, who had already missed one drop-goal attempt, split the posts from the tee to send Tigers up to fourth in the table, seven points above their fifth-placed local rivals.Leicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill:"Credit to them for getting back into it, but credit to our players for the first 30 minutes and then for digging themselves out of a hole they probably shouldn't have got themselves into."Good sides win when they do some average things, and we did some average things today but we found a way to win, however fortuitous that may or may not have been."Northampton Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder:"My reaction is clearly one of disappointment. I spoke to Courtney Lawes afterwards, and he said he tripped (in the incident that led to the last-minute penalty being awarded)."In the first half, we had a terrible 20 minutes - they were good, but we were terrible for 20 minutes - and you should not go 21-0 down at Welford Road."Leicester Tigers: Veainu; Betham, Tait, Smith, Thompstone; Williams, B Youngs; Ayerza, T Youngs (capt), Cole, De Chaves, Kitchener, Fitzgerald, O'Connor, McCaffrey.Replacements: Thacker, Mulipola, Balmain, Pearce, Croft, Harrison, Burns, Tuilagi.Northampton Saints: Foden; Elliott, North, Burrell, Collins; Hanrahan, Dickson (capt); Waller, Haywood, Hill, Lawes, Matfield, Gibson, Harrison, Dickinson.Replacements: Williams, Waller, Denman, Day, Wood, Kessell, Myler, Mallinder.For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.
A two-year-old boy also suffered serious head injuries in the crash in Birmingham.The driver of a black Vauxhall Astra ran from the scene in Eastfield Road, Bordesley Green, after crashing with a red Ford Fiesta.The driver of the Fiesta was eight weeks pregnant. Another child, a four-year-old boy, suffered minor injuries.More on this and other Birmingham storiesPC John Slater, from West Midland Police's traffic collision investigation unit, said: "Tragically the woman was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time and as a result of the collision suffered a miscarriage."I would like to hear form anyone who may have seen the crash to call police on 101."I would also ask that the driver does the right thing and makes contact with the police."Police said the crash happened on Saturday 2 April at 15.25 BST.
Watson, who climbs to a career-high 38th in the world rankings, is the first British woman since Anne Hobbs in 1985 to win a second tour title.The 22-year-old from Guernsey did not drop a set throughout the week.She now heads to the Australian Open, where she will play Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova in round one on Tuesday.Watson won her first WTA title in Osaka two years ago, before her career was interrupted by illness.She began last year ranked 119th in the world following a bout of glandular fever but has since recovered and begun working with Argentine coach Diego Veronelli.Victory in Hobart means Watson moved 11 places up the world rankings."Thanks to my coach Diego. It's been great working with you," she said afterwards."We work really hard but we also have fun."Brengle, the world number 84, was a surprise finalist having come through qualifying, but the 24-year-old made the early running in the final.After a rain-interrupted semi-final there was another early shower on Saturday, and Watson then survived a 14-minute opening service game that included six break points.The service struggles continued in the wind and Watson twice fell a break behind but was able to hit back immediately each time, levelling at 3-3 after a scrappy 44 minutes.Watson then made the decisive move as she reeled off three games to take the set, and after a steadier start to the second she went ahead again at 4-3.There was a hint of nerves when she slipped 15-30 behind while serving for the match, but Watson closed out the win and headed to the stands to hug coach Veronelli."When I won Osaka in 2012, it was more of a surprise," said Watson. "But here, I feel like I belong."I'm obviously very happy. It was tough conditions again today, very windy, and I knew Madison would be tough - we know each other very well on and off the court, and we practise a lot in Florida."It really was my toughest match of the week. I was happy I stayed mentally strong and managed to get ahead and hold my nerve at the end."
More than 7,000 children and adolescents had their mental health referrals rejected last year.The Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH) described the figure as "astonishing".The Scottish government has already said it will commission a review into rejected referrals.But SAMH said the issue needed to be addressed as quickly as possible because young people were "waiting now to get help and support".The charity's Jo Anderson said 17,500 people had been turned away from receiving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) support over the past three years.She added: "That's an astonishing figure, and we don't know what happens to them after they've been turned away. We don't know whether they received any other support."In the last few weeks of the campaign we've been running, we've been inundated with calls from parents who're in that situation and their child has been rejected from receiving a CAMHS service."They haven't been signposted anywhere else - that's a very worrying picture."Caitlin Wyllie-Quinn, 20, a student from Irvine, had a difficult transition to secondary school.Bullying left her isolated and very down, crying all the time.She got some initial help from the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service but after leaving therapy she went downhill rapidly.Her GP made another referral to CAMHS but this time it was rejected. Caitlin was told that because she was not suicidal or self-harming, her case was not serious enough."If the person doing the assessment had asked me if I was suicidal or self-harming I would have answered yes to both those questions, but basically I was refused help because they didn't have the capability to assess me properly," she said."I was at a real low point and I felt that getting referred to CAMHS was some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and finally maybe getting some help."For that to be stripped away from me made me feel even more worthless and just made things so much worse for me."The NHS in Scotland provides mental health services for children and young people with a wide range of mental health problems including anxiety, behaviour problems, depression and early onset psychosis.The Scottish government's mental health strategy commits it to carrying out reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals.Its mental health minister, Maureen Watt, said the reviews would happen "soon", and would allow improvements to be made to the system.Ms Anderson said this was encouraging, but added: "We really urge that to be quick and thorough because there are young people waiting now to get help and support."It might be that the CAMHS service isn't appropriate for them, but we simply don't know what the problem is."Meanwhile, statistics published on Tuesday also showed that a waiting time target for people to receive specialist mental health treatment has again been missed.The Scottish government has had a target in place since 2014 for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks of referral for mental health support.But the target has never been met nationally - with the latest figures showing that 83.6% of children and adolescents, and 73.7% of adults, were seen within the required timescale between January and March of this year.At the end of March, there were 6,932 children and young people across Scotland waiting for help from CAMHS, up from 6,359 at the end of December, according to the NHS statistics.At the same time, there were 20,952 adults waiting for treatment, compared to 20,195 in December.Average waiting times varied dramatically across the country, with 10 NHS boards meeting the target for CAMHS treatment but only three health boards meeting it for adult psychological care.The figures also showed that 74 children and young people starting their treatment had been waiting more than a year to be seen.NHS Grampian met the waiting time target for just 45.2% of young people, while in NHS Lothian the target was met for 47.8% of youngstersAnd in the NHS Forth Valley area, only 40% of adults starting psychological treatment between January and March were seen within 18 weeks, with an average wait of 25 weeks.A spokesman for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition (SCSC) said research has suggested 10% of children aged between five and 16 have a clinically diagnosable mental health problem.Pointing to a "clear postcode lottery" when it comes to treatment, he added: "We are deeply concerned about what is happening to the more than a fifth of children and young people not accepted for treatment."There is a need for an urgent inquiry to ascertain why these young people are being rejected for treatment and what is happening to them."Ms Watt, the mental health minster, said the number of health boards which had met the waiting time target for young people had increased from seven to 10 since the end of 2016.She added: "However, I'm clear that we must continue to reduce waiting times and I will not be satisfied until our target is met sustainably."Our recently published 10-year strategy for mental health sets out a range of measures that focus on prevention and early intervention to meet the mental health needs of children and young people, backed by Â£150m of funding."We will also soon commission reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals, as a foundation for making further improvements."
Kromtech - the Germany-based firm behind MacKeeper - has acknowledged that its customers' names, internet addresses and login credentials were among the data  exposed.However, it said that users' payment details were "never at risk".The firm believes the details were accessed only by the security expert who alerted it to the problem."The privacy and security of our clients' information remains our top priority and from the moment we were aware of the access, we immediately took several proactive steps to identify and correct the issue," it said in a statement."We want to offer a special 'thank you' to security researcher Chris Vickery for identifying the security breach attempt so that we could stop it before anyone was harmed."Mr Vickery told security blogger Brian Krebs that he had discovered 21 gigabytes of MacKeeper user data "after spending a few bored moments searching for database servers" that were not password-protected. He was able to do this by using Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices.Mr Krebs reported that Kromtech initially said that 13 million customers' details had been exposed.That figure was removed from the firm's statement - a spokesman for Kromtech told the BBC it had included both "active and non-active" users.MacKeeper is widely promoted on the web - including in prominent adverts on Ookla's Speedtest site - as a way to "clean" and "protect" Macintosh computers in order to help them run faster.However, critics have claimed that the software can cause computers to slow down and crash, and can be problematic to remove."There are no ways that the program itself can harm or de-stabilise the system as described by some sources," the Kromtech spokesman said.

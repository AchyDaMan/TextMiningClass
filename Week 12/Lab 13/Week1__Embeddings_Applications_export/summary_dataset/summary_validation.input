In a Commons debate, the ex-Labour leader said Conservative plans to limit the voting powers of Scottish MPs on Commons laws would "rip up" hundreds of years of parliamentary procedure.The SNP said the Conservatives wanted to create a "quasi-English Parliament".But ministers said it was vital England was treated fairly as further powers were devolved to other parts of the UK.At the end of the debate, Labour staged and won a vote in which the government abstained. And Conservative MP David Davis raised a point of order to urge the government to allow more time for the matter to be considered.The government believes bills applying exclusively to England should not become law without the explicit consent of MPs from English constituencies and it wants to change Commons rules known as standing orders to give them a "decisive say" during their passage.Ministers say this will address the longstanding anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting England but English MPs have no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved.Mark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondentPanic stations? From the point of view of the government whips this afternoon's emergency Commons debate on English Votes for English Laws was really rather alarming.The debate, so skilfully secured by Lib Dem ex Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael, produced a slightly pointless vote in which the Conservatives mostly abstained, but it brought all kinds of nasty tensions to the surface.Conservative MPs are supposed to be signed up for EVEL under the terms of their manifesto, but there were clearly quite a few with doubts, some about the policy, many more about the process, which was Mr Carmichael's line of attack.Read the article in fullHowever, the plans came under sustained attack from Labour, SNP and Lib Dems in an urgent debate, secured by former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael.MPs are due to debate and vote on the government's plans next week but Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the plans required more detailed consideration, arguably through primary legislation.If MPs representing constituencies in England had a "veto" on certain legislation, it would breach the longstanding principle that MPs, no matter who they represented, were "all equal"."To go as far as the government wants to go in the timescale they want to go brings with it an attendant level of risk that I would consider to be irresponsible," he said."They are not entitled to use the UK Parliament as a proxy for an English Parliament."Assurances that the new system would be reviewed by MPs after a year were inadequate, he added, saying this would not be capable of "putting a dangerous genie back in the bottle after it had been let out - we all know that is the political reality".But Commons Leader Chris Grayling said it was "simply incorrect" to claim some MPs would be prevented from debating and voting on certain legislation and would continue to exercise the same rights as they do now.Pressed by Mr Miliband on "what the meaning and definition" of English-only legislation would be, Mr Grayling said it would be up to the Speaker to decide but he believed a "simple test" would be what things were devolved to Scotland.Requiring bills to have the support of a "double majority" of the whole of the Commons and those MPs representing England would also help mitigate "any resentment" felt by English voters about the slower pace of devolution to England."It is of vital importance that English citizens of the UK, as we move to an extra layer of devolution to Scotland and Wales and devolve additional tax powers to Northern Ireland, that they think it is fair," he said."It is what we pledged to do in our manifesto. We set it out in detail, step by step by step. We are implementing these changes and keeping our promises. I think the people who elected us would expect nothing else."Mr Miliband said the Conservatives had the power to address the issue after winning the election but urged them to think again."Is this true to the traditions of Conservatism? No because the last thing you do is rip up hundreds of years of constitutional practice in a standing order vote just before the House goes into recess," he said."Doing this procedure in the way it is being proposed is an act of constitutional vandalism. It really is."The SNP said Scottish voters would be affected by legislation on schools and NHS budgets in England through the Barnett Formula used to allocate public spending to different nations of the UK."This not just English votes for English laws, this is English votes for Scottish laws," said Pete Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire. "It is totally and utterly unacceptable."He added: "Why don't they just tattoo our foreheads 'Scottish' and then they would be able to identify us."And Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh said the move would not make any difference to the outcome of votes and urged ministers to omit laws which indirectly applied to Scotland, saying not to do so would be a "gift" to the SNP's independence campaign.Responding to a question by an SNP MP on Monday, Mr Grayling said the only English-only measure during the last Parliament had been the Education Bill, and there were 13 Bills which applied to England and Wales.
Mr Glanville won 69% of the votes cast and was already acting mayor.Prior to Thursday's by-election he had been deputy mayor of the borough.Green Party candidate Samir Jeraj came second in the election with 13%.Labour currently control the borough of Hackney with a majority of 43 seats.The by-election was called after former Hackney mayor Jules Pipe stood down after 14 years.Mr Pipe will work with London mayor Sadiq Khan in City Hall as the city's deputy mayor for planning, regeneration and skills.
The animal has been studied for some time, but new research confirms it is different from all other gibbons.It has been named the Skywalker hoolock gibbon - partly because the Chinese characters of its scientific name mean "Heaven's movement" but also because the scientists are fans of Star Wars.The study is published in the American Journal of Primatology.Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, who was part of the team studying the apes, told BBC News: "In this area, so many species have declined or gone extinct because of habitat loss, hunting and general human overpopulation."So it's an absolute privilege to see something as special and as rare as a gibbon in a canopy in a Chinese rainforest, and especially when it turns out that the gibbons are actually a new species previously unrecognised by science."Hoolock gibbons are found in Bangladesh, India, China and Myanmar. They spend most of their time living in the treetops, swinging through the forests with their forelimbs, rarely spending any time on the ground.But the research team - led by Fan Peng-Fei from Sun Yat-sen University in China - started to suspect that the animals they were studying in China's Yunnan Province were unusual.All hoolock gibbons have white eyebrows and some have white beards - but the Chinese primates' markings differed in appearance.Their songs, which they use to bond with other gibbons and to mark out their territory, also had an unusual ring.So the team carried out a full physical and genetic comparison with other gibbons, which confirmed that the primates were indeed a different species.They have been given the scientific name of Hoolock tianxing - but their common name is now the Skywalker hoolock gibbon, thanks to the scientists' taste in films.Dr Turvey said the team had been studying the animals in the Gaoligongshan nature reserve, but it was not easy."It's difficult to get into the reserve. You have to hike up to above 2,500m to find the gibbons. That's where the good quality forest usually starts - everywhere below there has been logged."Then you have to wake up really early in the morning and you listen out for the haunting song of the gibbons, which carries in the forest canopy."And when you hear it, you rush through the mud and the mist, and run for hundreds of metres to try and catch up with these gibbons."The researchers estimate that there are about 200 of the Skywalker gibbons living in China - and also some living in neighbouring Myanmar, although the population size there is currently unknown.The team warns that the primates are at risk of extinction."The low number of surviving animals and the threat they face from habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and hunting means we think they should be classified as an endangered species," said Dr Turvey.In response to the news, actor Mark Hamill - the original Luke Skywalker - said on Twitter that he was so proud to have a new jungle Jedi named after his character.Follow Rebecca on Twitter.
Jamie Peacock, Kevin Sinfield and Kylie Leuluai ended their careers and left the club after beating Wigan Warriors at Old Trafford on Saturday.The win followed success in the League Leaders' Shield and Challenge Cup to complete a domestic treble.The trio were honoured at a celebratory event at the First Direct Arena.Speaking after winning the Grand Final, former England captain Peacock said: "It's a bit difficult to sum up. I'm lost for words."I just feel fortunate to be in a great team. It's a team sport and that's why rugby league is such a great sport."Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake said: "It has been another amazing season for the Leeds Rhinos and [the event] is an opportunity for supporters to congratulate the team on their efforts and also say a big thank you to legends Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Kylie Leuluai.""We are extremely proud as a city of the Rhinos, whose commitment, dedication and achievements on the field - coupled with the work they do in our communities - is simply fantastic."They are undoubtedly fully deserving of an event such as this."Leeds Rhinos chief executive, Gary Hetherington, said it would be a "spectacular live show" with performances from The Pigeon Detectives showing appreciation for the three retiring stars.
It took seven people to help lift the male Staffordshire bull terrier out of the waterway near Litherland Road in Bootle, Liverpool on Saturday.A blue rope was tied around its neck and tests indicated it had been strangled, the RSPCA said.An examination at Greater Manchester Animal Hospital found the dog had been fed and walked before it died.He was in a good condition with short nails and had eaten recently, the animal welfare charity confirmed.RSPCA Inspector Helen Smith said it was not clear if the dog was alive when it was thrown in the canal.She said: "If he was dead when he was thrown in, it would have taken at least two people to get him in there as the dog was heavy, as was the rucksack."He could have also been walked down there alive, thrown into the canal and choked by the weight around his neck."Anyone with information is urged to contact the RSPCA.
The New South Wales premier's page was flooded with comments, almost all negative, after he mounted a defence of controversial "lockout laws" that many say have killed off Sydney's night-time economy.Mr Baird says the laws are reducing assaults, and that a number of small bars have opened since the laws were introduced.But questions have also been raised about why the city's Star Casino and another planned casino are exempt - the Star falls just outside the zone - leading to the premier being mocked with the hashtag #casinomike.Since February 2014, bars and clubs within parts of Sydney have been required to shut their doors to new patrons from 1.30 in the morning and stop serving drinks at 3:00, with severe penalties for bar owners who breach the conditions.Sales of takeaway alcohol from hotels and shops are banned statewide after 22:00.The origin of these laws can be traced to July 2012, when 19-year-old Kieran Loveridge walked up to Thomas Kelly in the entertainment precinct of Kings Cross and, without provocation or warning, punched him in the head.Mr Kelly, 19, fell to the ground and later died in hospital.Kings Cross saw its second "coward punch" death on New Year's Eve in 2013, when bodybuilder Shaun McNeil, 27, killed 18-year-old Daniel Christie with a single blow in an unprovoked attack.Both attackers were jailed.Public outcry over these incidents was immense, and the NSW government responded by designating Sydney's most popular party zones a "CBD Entertainment Precinct".But it had a devastating impact on businesses that depended on late-night trade, particularly around the Kings Cross area.Some of Australia's best-known bars and clubs shut down, among them Hugos Lounge, which had operated for 15 years and was voted best nightclub in Australia six times.Owner Dave Evans said the laws caused a 60% drop in trade, forcing him to close his doors and put 170 staff out of work.Frustration over the laws' impact on Sydney's nightlife crystalysed last week with the publication on LinkedIn of an 8,000-word essay by businessman Matt Barrie.Mr Barrie passionately denounced the impact of the laws and pushed a philosophy of personal responsibility that touched a nerve with many Sydneysiders."You've been tricked into thinking that you have done something wrong, in some way that you are genetically an idiot, or that somehow you have to feel responsible for a couple of random tragic, yet unrelated, events that occurred in the vague proximity of having fun," he wrote."Two young men that would be turning in their graves if they knew that their deaths had been hijacked to beat up some moral outrage over the sort of human tragedy that sells newspapers to put up a political smokescreen, push a prohibitionist evangelical agenda, sell a suburb to developers, and boost the coffers of a couple of casinos."Reaction to Mr Barrie's piece prompted Mr Baird, a conservative and Christian, to respond on social media, where he had previous success live-tweeting amusing responses to the finale of reality television show The Bachelor."Alcohol-related assaults have decreased 42.2% in the CBD since we introduced the 'lockout laws'. And they are down by over 60% in Kings Cross," he wrote."But didn't we achieve this by shutting down the whole city and killing its nightlife? The number of small bars in Sydney has more than doubled in the same period.""Doctors right across the city are now telling us they are seeing far less emergency room presentations on the weekends."But this time the move appears to have backfired, with the post attracting more than 12,000 comments, overwhelmingly negative."I am not proud of our city and embarrassed to invite guests here from overseas," said one.Another said the state was "treating us all like kids because of the actions of random street scum"."Sydney has a rich history of the inner city pub which you are destroying," said another. "Thanks mate #casinomike."Popular Australian DJ and musician Alison Wonderland was one of the many who responded to Mr Baird."Words can't explain how embarrassed I am that my home, the most beautiful and once most vibrant city in the world has become a laughing stock internationally," she wrote."People are asking me if it's true Sydney has become a nanny state and voice their genuine concerns about visiting it."Another commenter was Justin Maloney, owner of the restaurant Jimmy Liks, which closed last month after 14 years."You said you wanted to 'eliminate drinking ghettos' - well, Mr Baird, my award-winning restaurant was no ghetto but you certainly eliminated it," he wrote.Even Mr Baird's "cherry picked" assault statistics were called into question.The lockout laws are almost two years old now and due to be subjected to a detailed review.But Mr Baird indicated he was unlikely to change the policy, which he believed was "so clearly improving the city".But it remains to be seen if the popular premier will hold his ground if anger at the lockout laws continues to gather momentum.
England lost both home one-day series in the summer, against Sri Lanka and India, and have won only seven of their 18 one-day internationals this year.They are now touring Sri Lanka in the build-up to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, starting in February.Finn, 25, told BBC Sport: "If we stick together, I think we're capable of upsetting people at the World Cup."England beat Sri Lanka A by 56 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method in their opening match of the winter on Friday.They face the same opposition on Sunday prior to a seven-match one-day international series against the full Sri Lanka side.England are not among the favourites for the World Cup, but Middlesex right-armer Finn believes their status could benefit them."It suits us to go over there as underdogs and if we can slip under the radar having had a good month of preparation under our belt here in Sri Lanka," he said."In the last few games of the season we put in some good performances against India, who are arguably the best one-day team in the world."If we can get some belief and team ethics in place to go forward into the World Cup that should stand us in good stead."
Media playback is not supported on this deviceWalkden became the first Briton to successfully defend a taekwondo world title with victory in the +73kg category at the 2017 tournament.She says she speaks "all the time" about MMA with double Olympic taekwondo champion and compatriot Jade Jones."You never know what the future holds," the 25-year-old said. "You'd have to train completely different."Speaking to Radio 5 live's Sportsweek, she added: "If we got offered a spectacular fight, it was a one-off, a big event - then I would definitely do it."Jones said last year that she could be tempted by a big-money move to MMA after the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
Media playback is not supported on this deviceThere was never more than a frame between the two before Higgins produced a break of 85 to move into a 5-4 lead.Liang missed a green along the cushion to allow Higgins, who had made three centuries of 119, 104 and 133, to win.UK Championship winner Neil Robertson had an easier victory as he thrashed an out-of-sorts Marco Fu 6-0.Fu was ill with a virus on Tuesday and nearly pulled out of the match.Media playback is not supported on this deviceRobertson will now play world number five Judd Trump in the quarter-final on Friday, which starts at 13:00 GMT.Higgins faces world champion Stuart Bingham from 19:00 GMT on the same day."A lot of players will think it was an easy shot on the green, but I knew it was difficult," said Higgins after his win over Liang."It was great to come through. We all know he is a great player. He played great today, stuck in there and potted some unbelievable balls."He added: "If I play like that I have got a chance against anybody."
Kensington and Chelsea council said it had given the owner a section 215 notice ordering the stripes' removal after neighbours complained.The stripes appeared earlier this month after plans to demolish the house and replace it with a new house and two-storey basement were refused.Neighbours said it looked "hideous".The house, in a quiet cul-de-sac, must be repainted by 3 July.The owner has until 5 June to appeal the decision.A council spokesman said: "The property is situated within the Kensington Square Conservation Area and its condition and appearance has attracted numerous complaints to the council's planning enforcement team."
Mr Smith told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Labour would be "decimated" if there was an election tomorrow.He insisted there was "everything still to play for" in the contest and would not rule out standing again if Mr Corbyn won.Mr Corbyn's campaign said Mr Smith was "desperate" and "resorting to insults".The current leader points to a surge in party membership under his stewardship as evidence that he is building a "mass movement" capable of winning a general election, with his allies saying the Tories are "in retreat".But Mr Smith said: "I think that's delusional, and I think Jeremy needs to think a bit more about that straight, honest politics that he started his campaign with."He said: "The straight, honest truth is that we are right now at our lowest ebb in the polls, ever."If there was an election tomorrow Labour would be decimated, and that's got to be a shock to Labour's system."He said Mr Corbyn was "misleading himself if he thinks we are heading towards an election victory".If Labour continued on its current "disastrous trajectory", Mr Smith said, it would be left with as little as 140 MPs. It currently has 230, with the Conservatives on 329."If Jeremy is deluding himself that we are heading to victory I do not think the rest of the party or the country can afford to be deluded about where we are," he said, claiming Labour was "in the doldrums" and that it faced "Groundhog Day" if Mr Corbyn won.Labour will announce its new leader at a special conference on 24 September.Mr Corbyn, who won an overwhelming victory in last summer's leadership contest, is the bookies' favourite.But Mr Smith said he would "fight this right up until the last minute", saying many people had yet to vote.Asked whether he would stand for the leadership again if Mr Corbyn wins, he said: "I am not ruling anything in or anything out," adding that this was "a hypothetical question for the dim and distant future".A spokesman for Mr Corbyn's campaign said: "You can tell things are going from bad to worse for Owen Smith's desperate campaign as he turns his vitriol on Labour members instead of the Tory government."The inconvenient truth for Owen Smith is that Labour polled ahead of the Tories in May's local elections; and we have won all parliamentary by-elections under Jeremy's leadership, as well as having won mayoral elections in Bristol, London, Liverpool and Salford."Rather than repeatedly talking down our party, and refusing to accept the outcome of this contest, Owen Smith should reflect on his use of such a divisive approach for the rest of this contest."
Tomasz Procko, 22, and Karol Szymanski, 29, had been delivering sofas to the Knightsbridge property on Friday morning when the balcony collapsed.Mr Procko, of Greenford, west London, died at the scene while Mr Szymanski, of Wembley, north-west London, died later in hospital.Both men were originally from Poland. Their next of kin had been informed.Eight other people were treated for injuries, the London Ambulance Service said.A neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, told BBC News: "They were trying to pull a couch up to the first-floor apartment with ropes."[It] was apparently too heavy. The fence broke off and fell on the workmen below."Sinclair Johnston, an engineer who has worked on another property in the square, said the decorative railings could not be depended upon to support weight.The decorative wrought-iron railing appeared to have fallen about 3.6m (12ft) to the ground, although the stone base of the balcony appeared undamaged.
The US central bank said it had unanimously agreed to keep rates at close to zero this month, but believed the economy was on a stronger footing."Economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months," it said in a statement.But it still did not give a clear indication of when rates would rise.In its statement, the Fed noted that the job market, housing and consumer spending had all improved.The central bank's policy makers also said they expected inflation to rise gradually toward its 2% target.On employment - which is now at a seven-year low of 5.3% - the bank said job gains had been "solid", more  positive language than last month.But it again reiterated that it would only hike its benchmark interest rate "when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective".The Fed's decision to keep its main interest rate on hold this month had been widely expected."The bottom line is they didn't do a lot."But they've nudged the market in the direction of a 2015 rate hike. And it's increased our confidence in a September rate hike," Millan Mulraine, deputy head of US strategy at TD Securities told the BBC.Barclays economist Michael Gapen said that he also still expected a rate rise in September, which he said remained the bank's "baseline forecast"And Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds, said the statement confirmed the Fed was "taking baby steps" towards an increase.The interest rate has now been at a record low for six and a half years.The US central bank's decision to cut the rate to such a low level in December 2008 was aimed at boosting growth in the economy amid the global financial crisis.Most analysts expect the first hike in September, but Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has emphasised that any increase will be determined by the latest economic data.She has also said that when rates do begin to rise, the increase will only be gradual.US stock markets, which were up ahead of the Fed's decision, continued to trade higher after the decision.

The 22-year-old barber, from Newtownabbey, County Antrim, has not been seen for almost a week.He was last seen in the Carnmoney Road area of Newtownabbey shortly before 13:00 BST on Thursday, 13 July.Officers have also revised details of what they believe he was wearing on the day of his disappearance.Det Insp Chris Millar said: "It has now been established that Dean was wearing a short-sleeve maroon shirt, denim knee-length shorts and dark-coloured canvas shoes."He was wearing a gold watch on his right wrist."Mr McIlwaine is 5'8" in height and of medium build.He has dark hair, a beard and sleeve tattoos on both arms.Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to contact police by calling 101, quoting reference number 121 of 14/7/17.
Regardless of the horse race that sprung from Lord Derby calling it right and winning that toss at Epsom in 1779, defeat would have had a much wider significance.The event and its name are believed to be the root of the expression 'derby match', and it's worth considering that the loser was Sir Charles Bunbury.You'll agree the 'Merseyside Bunbury' or the 'North London Bunbury' hardly have the same ring.More than two centuries on from that coin toss to decide whose name the race should take, trainer John Gosden - who is due to have five runners in the 238th Derby, including big fancy Cracksman - marvels at what was created."It's a unique track," he says, staring out over the course as it snakes its way up, down and around the Surrey Downs barely 15 miles south west of central London."Obviously Bunbury and Derby had had a very good lunch when they came up here and pegged it out and flipped a coin."It's a very demanding track. You have to stay, you have to have great dexterity, agility, balance and a turn of foot comes in very handy."It is a proper test of a horse - you wouldn't necessarily design it as a track for anything other than a rigorous test of a three-year-old in the first week of June, and that's what it is."Gosden, whose ever-powerful string based at Newmarket is the biggest threat to the prevailing dominance of Ireland's Aidan O'Brien, should know.It's 20 years since he saddled Benny The Dip to win, and two since he masterminded Golden Horn's big-race success with Frankie Dettori riding in the silks of owner-breeder Anthony Oppenheimer.Golden Horn, who by that point had won the regularly significant Dante Stakes at York, went on to stamp his authority on proceedings that season.After Epsom, he galloped off with the Eclipse Stakes, the Irish Champion Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before suffering one of just two defeats, at the Breeders' Cup fixture in Kentucky.Cracksman represents the same owner-trainer-jockey combination, and comes to Epsom with two wins from two starts, the second at Epsom when narrowly beating fellow Derby hopeful - and this year's Dante winner - Permian."Cracksman is not a Golden Horn," Gosden told BBC Sport, "but he's a superior horse to Benny The Dip."He's still learning a lot, and when he came here and won the trial he grew up overnight, so we're excited."Believing there is no standout in this year's Derby, worth a total of nearly £1.625m - a record, Gosden fields three more runners than ever before.Cracksman, who like fellow leading contender Eminent is a son of champion racehorse-turned-fledgling stallion Frankel, is joined by striking Goodwood winner Khalidi - added as a late entry, for £85,000 - plus three longer shots in Crowned Eagle, Glencadam Glory and Pealer.A multitude of runners under a single, or near-single, banner is something of a feature of the 2017 staging of the world's best-known flat racing prize.O'Brien - looking for a sixth win after Galileo, High Chaparral, Camelot, Ruler Of The World and Australia - saddles another formidable Coolmore-owned challenge.Cliffs Of Moher, winner of the Dee Stakes at Chester, with Ryan Moore riding, leads six, ahead of well-supported Capri and Venice Beach. Douglas Macarthur, The Anvil - on which the trainer's apprentice jockey daughter Ana becomes the third female jockey to take part - and Wings Of Eagle make up the raiding party.O'Brien's son Joseph, the jockey on board when Camelot and Australia were victorious but now training, saddles Rekindling.Via his Godolphin operation and his son Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, owner Sheikh Mohammed is represented by Permian, Lingfield Trial winner Best Solution, once-raced Dubai Thunder and Benbatl, the Dante Stakes runner-up.Strongly supported Eminent, sixth in the 2000 Guineas, trained by Martyn Meade and the mount of flat racing's champion jockey Jim Crowley, heads 'the rest'.It does look genuinely wide open."We don't have any exceptional favourite standing out and frightening everyone away," said Gosden, whose father 'Towser' trained 1966 winner Charlottown as a two-year-old before ill health forced his own retirement."That's why we're winding up with a pretty big field. But I still think that the first three will be very, very good horses."The biggest problem is probably going to be for the jockeys getting around in a big field. You try riding around Epsom with so many other runners. It's not an easy job at all."Food for thought for apprentice jockey Paddy Pilley, who replaces Gina Mangan - barred from taking part on safety grounds - on 1,000-1 outsider Diore Lia.However, the presence of Diore Lia, the large field and the chance for Frankel to father a first European Classic winner gives the whole thing an intriguing narrative.It'll take a lot more than a spin of a coin to sort out this one.
Swansea's Indoor Market and bus station were also closed but officers reopened affected areas just before 17:00 BST.South Wales Police had received reports of a suspect package at about 14:00.They said the incident had caused "significant disruption".Bus operator First Cymru said services were returning to normal but delays may continue.A police spokesman said: "While we ask people to be vigilant, we will take robust action against anyone who causes significant disruption through hoax activity."

It marks the sixth time in four years that the web portal has announced sizeable job cuts.The news coincides with plans by Skype to create about 400 new posts across five cities.The internet video-calling business - which is owned by Microsoft - said it was initially looking to take on staff in London and Stockholm.Other posts will later be created in Tallinn, Estonia; Prague, Czech Republic; and Palo Alto in California, US.Yahoo said its cuts aimed to deliver a"smaller, nimbler, more profitable"company that was cheaper to run. It added that the action was designed to save about $375m (Â£236m) a year.The move follows a period of turmoil at the firm.Carol Bartz was dismissed as chief executive in September after failing to turn around the company's fortunes. Chairman Roy Bostock and co-founder Jerry Yang also later resigned from its board.In January, former Paypal executive Scott Thompson was named the organisation's fourth chief executive in five years.A recent study by the analytics company Comscore suggested that Yahoo's share of online search queries in the USfell below 14% for the first time in February, putting it further behind Google and Microsoft.A statement issued by Mr Thompson's said: "We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities. Our goal is to get back to our core purpose -putting our users and advertisers first - and we are moving aggressively to achieve that goal."It added that the firm would now focus on a "deep" personalised experience for users and a return on investment for investors.The firm has not given any indication of when the cuts would be made. It said it would provide more information about its "future direction" when it released an earnings update on 17 April.As Yahoo shrinks, Skype is growing. Once all the new positions are filled, the business expects to have 1,600 employees worldwide.As part of the expansion it is launching a new technology centre in central London. It says the move would increase its headcount in the city by 40% to 330 posts.The UK government's desire to monitor people using its services did not influence Skype's decisionIt aims to have completed the first stage of the hiring process by the end of June.Skype's vice-president of product and design told the BBC the new jobs would cover software engineering, product management and design."We have one project about 'big data', which is about making use of data that our users generate when using the product to improve the quality of the products we offer," said Rick Osterloh."We also a number of initiatives we are working on in the web area, and we are hiring some positions for our newly formed Xbox division."Skype's move signals that it is not overly concerned about the UK government's intention to give the country's security services increased access to internet data.Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has specifically identified Skype as one of the services that the government wants to be monitored.A statement from Skype said that: "We are not in a position to comment on the UK government's proposed legislation. We do of course comply with legislation in all countries in which we operate."Skype's use of peer-to-peer technology for its call and instant-messaging services means that it does not store the contents of communications on its servers, and so could not hand the information over unless it changed its systems.
The Doncaster Central MP was one of three members to be chosen in a secret ballot, succeeding Natascha Engel who lost her seat at the election.Labour's Lindsay Hoyle topped the ballot and was re-elected as chairman of ways and means. In that role, he will preside over Budget debates.Tory Eleanor Laing was also re-elected as another deputy to John Bercow.The Commons Speaker, who has held the role since 2009, was himself re-elected without a formal vote two weeks ago.As he first stood for the Commons as a Conservative MP, Mr Bercow's deputies must be comprised of one Conservative and two opposition MPs to ensure balance.Labour's Roberta Blackman-Woods was the only other candidate who stood in the election. Details of the number of votes each candidate got will be published later.As no other Conservative candidate put their name forward, Mrs Laing was automatically chosen as first deputy chair of ways and means.Deputy speakers, who stand in for Mr Bercow in the main Commons chamber and have a range of other duties, were elected for the first time in 2010.
Complaints about data collection by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 were put forward by campaign group Privacy International.The ruling said some data collection did not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).But it added that proper statutory supervision was put in place last year.It was a "highly significant judgement", Privacy International said.As part of its review of the spy agencies' activities, the IPT examined the organisations' collection of communications data - involving the "who, where, when, how and with whom" was involved in conversations, but not their contents - and personal information about people.Such data is "vital for identifying and developing intelligence targets", according to GCHQ.Article 8 of the ECHR states, however, that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary."It is very significant," said Graham Smith of London law firm Bird & Bird.He added that much of the data collection had been carried out under an older piece of law - section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984."It gave absolutely no clue at all that it could be used for this particular purpose," said Mr Smith."Everyone accepts that what the agencies do operationally has to be secret, but the laws that say what they can and can't do shouldn't be secret."An official policy about how such data collection should be carried out lawfully came into force in February 2015 - this was put into practice by the intelligence agencies later the same year.It included guidance as to how collected data should be acquired, managed and destroyedThe tribunal found that, prior to this, personal datasets compiled by spy agencies did not comply with Article 8 and were therefore "unlawful"."The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens," said the Home Office in a statement."We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes."It added that the government was "committed" to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers available to intelligence agencies.
Another five soldiers were wounded in a rocket attack on Turkish tanks, the military said in a statement.The fatalities are believed to be the first since Turkey launched its operation inside Syria two weeks ago.Two fighters from the Free Syrian Army were also killed and another two injured in the attack."Two of our hero comrades were martyred and five were wounded in a rocket attack on two of our tanks by Daesh (IS) elements," the army statement said.The rocket attack was launched near the village of al-Waqf, it added.Syrian rebels backed by Turkey say they have recaptured a number of villages from IS since the Turkish operation - code-named Euphrates Shield - began.The rebels have also retaken the key border town of Jarabulus.On Sunday, Turkey said IS fighters were pushed out of their last positions along the Turkish-Syrian border.Turkish forces have targeted IS inside Syria, but have also attacked Kurdish fighters in the same region.The pursuit of the Kurdish YPG militia has led to criticism by Washington, which regards the Kurds as one of the most effective forces in the battle against IS.
A statue of General Robert E Lee was among those taken down from the Austin campus early on Monday.Monuments to Confederate figures are symbols of "modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism", the college said.A woman's death at a far-right rally in Charlottesville has reignited debate over America's racial legacy."Last week, the horrific displays of hatred at the University of Virginia and in Charlottesville shocked and saddened the nation," University of Texas at Austin President Greg Fenves said on Sunday."These events make it clear, now more than ever, that Confederate monuments have become symbols of modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism."As well as Lee, who was military commander during the 1861-65 American Civil War, a statue of another rebel general, Albert Sidney Johnston, and of Confederate postmaster John H Reagan were taken down.They were moved to a centre for American history on campus.A statue of Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg, who served from 1891-95, was also removed and will be considered for re-installation at another site."The University of Texas at Austin has a duty to preserve and study history," Mr Fenves continued."But our duty also compels us to acknowledge that those parts of our history that run counter to the university's core values, the values of our state and the enduring values of our nation do not belong on pedestals in the heart of the Forty Acres."The university removed a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis from its campus in 2015 following a mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.Mr Fenves added that he spoke with members of faculty, students and alumni following the deadly demonstrations in Virginia.Dozens of schools and local governments have begun removing statues dedicated to the Confederacy, which was a pro-slavery rebellion against the federal government.It follows violent clashes at a march on 12 August in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists and neo-Nazis protested against the removal of a monument of General Lee.A 32-year-old woman was killed and nearly 20 people injured when a car was driven into a crowd of counter-protesters.Last week, four Confederate-era statues were taken down in Baltimore, Maryland, while the governors of Virginia and North Carolina have ordered the removal of similar monuments in their states.Recent removals of Confederate statues has sparked backlash among an outspoken group of Americans who view the statues as symbols of US history and southern culture.President Donald Trump weighed in on the debate on Thursday, tweeting that controversial monuments are "beautiful", adding that they would be "greatly missed" from US cities.But opponents argue the monuments serve as an offensive reminder of America's history of slavery and racial oppression."The historical and cultural significance of the Confederate statues on our campus - and the connections that individuals have with them - are severely compromised by what they symbolise," Mr Fenves said."Erected during the period of Jim Crow laws and segregation, the statues represent the subjugation of African Americans. That remains true today for white supremacists who use them to symbolise hatred and bigotry.
Skills Development Scotland, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, ScotlandIS and Education Scotland are backing the Â£250,000 fund called Digital Xtra.Among the aims of the scheme is to support extracurricular computing clubs for youngsters aged 16 and under.A panel will evaluate submissions for funding.Representatives from technology businesses, Scottish government and education will be on the panel.
The 20-year-old Frenchman joined Celtic from Fulham in the summer, with his 32-goal haul ensuring he is now one of Europe's most sought-after strikers.And Rodgers insists Dembele has benefited massively from making the switch to Scotland's top-flight."He's developed very well and met the challenge to play for a big club, feel pressure and win trophies," he said."He wants to improve and that's the type of player you want to work with."Dembele cost Celtic a development fee of just £500,000 but his value has rocketed after a stunning debut season.Rodgers concedes that the striker will leave the club one day but expects a lot more from him before that time comes."I think we all know at some point he will move on, it's just about timing," Rodgers told BBC Sport."But I know at this point he's very happy here. He's only 20 and he's been a joy to work with."There's no doubt there will be a natural point in time that he goes, I think we all understand that. Unfortunately, that's how it goes up here. But if he serves the club well in his time here that's all we can ask for."Media playback is not supported on this deviceCeltic will win the Premiership title if they beat Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday.They are unbeaten in the league this season, have already won the League Cup and are in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup.Rodgers described the club's unbeaten run as "incredible" but knows his side have a lot to do to go through the whole campaign without suffering a loss."I think the unbeaten one is very difficult," he said. "We have nine games to go and the last five games you go into a split. The last five are against top six teams so it becomes really difficult."In terms of the treble, we never really mention it. We have to stabilise that emotion and just think about performing and playing well."We want to win every game we play. For the remainder of season we will push as hard as we have all season - I think the group is getting better as they play more together."Watch the full Football Focus interview on BBC One on Saturday from 12:00 BST.
Terry Smith, 33, died in hospital in November 2013, a day after being held in Surrey under the Mental Health Act.He had been taken to Staines police station and kept in restraints.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service.The IPCC said two sergeants, one of whom had retired, and a health worker contracted to Surrey Police could face charges of gross negligence manslaughter and misconduct in public office.It had investigated eight police officers and two staff,  the methods used to detain Mr Smith and why he was kept under restraint at the police station.Police arrested Terry Smith, a father who lived locally, in Stanwell at about 22:00 GMT on 12 November 2013 after a call for assistance from an ambulance crew.He fell ill and was taken to St Peter's hospital in Chertsey, where he died the following day.IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor said:  "We have now completed our investigation into the events leading up to Mr Smith's death."I have decided to refer the case to the CPS to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought against any officer."My thoughts remain with everyone affected by Mr Smith's death."
The hotel chain said the investment programme would bring 150 jobs and 10 apprenticeships.Two of the new hotels, located off the Royal Mile on New Market Street, will open at the end of this month.The third, which will be in York Place in the New Town, is scheduled to open in late spring.The new sites will take the total number of Premier Inn hotels in the city to 14, with more than 1,500 rooms.One of the two hotels on the Royal Mile will be a hi-tech "hub by Premier Inn", the chain's first in Scotland. The hub will allow guests to control their room settings using an Apple Watch.Additional investment by Premier Inn in the city includes a £1.8m extension at Premier Inn Newcraighall and a £1.2m refurbishment at Edinburgh Central.Simon Ewins, chief operating officer for Premier Inn and hub, said: "We are absolutely delighted to be opening three new fantastic hotels in Edinburgh and it is great that we are able to bring so many jobs and apprenticeships to the city."Hub is a new concept for us which we are really excited about, especially as this is the first one in Scotland and outside of London."We are confident our guests visiting the beautiful city of Edinburgh will enjoy this new digital experience and we will look to open more in Scotland in the future."
Courts such as Stirling, Kilmarnock and Dundee were jailing nearly 20% of women appearing before them, compared to 7% in Edinburgh and 5% in Airdrie.The judiciary said it was not appropriate for an active sheriff to be interviewed for the programme, but retired sheriff Peter Gillam gave the view from the bench. He served as a sheriff from 1991 until 2013, and said the variations reflected the independence of the judiciary.He said: "Obviously there is now, as I understand it, a board set up for advising on sentence to the judiciary."But every judge is his own person or her own person, and they all have different ways of dealing with things, they all have different views and they are all independent."There has to be a certain degree of uniformity and that is undoubtedly enforced by the existence of an Appeal Court so anyone who does something which is particularly outrageous, as far as what is perceived to be the appropriate way of dealing with people, that can be corrected."But variety is the spice of life and I think that it would be wrong to try to dragoon the judiciary into dealing with things which they believe to be the correct way of dealing with things."They have local knowledge, they know the person, they have full information and they deal with it to the best of their ability and you have to trust that person to deal with it in that particular way."
The 25-year-old batsman died from a haemorrhage in the brain two days after being hit on the neck during a match in Sydney on 25 November 2014.The five-day hearing was convened to examine if his death was avoidable.Some players giving testimony at the inquest have been accused of dishonesty for saying they could not recall many of the events of the day.The inquest, which began on Monday at New South Wales Coroner's Court, heard evidence from players including Brad Haddin, Doug Bollinger and David Warner.The court examined whether Hughes, batting for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales, had been targeted by short-pitch bowling, or had received unsettling comments from opponents.Questions were also raised about whether a bowler told Hughes "I'm going to kill you" before he was fatally injured.Hughes' parents walked out of the inquest as the counsel representing the family, Greg Melick SC, criticised the players for repeatedly answering many questions by saying "no recollection" or "I can't recall"."At the end of the day, there was a plan, there was sledging, and short-pitched balls were bowled at Phillip Hughes, which increased the risk of an injury," Mr Melick said."Nine consecutive short-pitched balls from the one bowler aimed at leg stump or the body of the batsman was going too far."Suggestions of fabricated evidence were denied by the counsel representing Cricket Australia and its players.Hughes' brother and sister later exited the inquest as the sworn statements from the players were defended.The counsel assisting the coroner, Kristina Stern SC, said concerns about sledging and short balls were "unnecessary" and should not form part of the findings.NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will deliver his finding from the inquest on 4 November.A previous report, commissioned by Cricket Australia, said protective helmets should be compulsory for batsman facing fast- and medium-paced bowling.But it said helmets meeting the newest safety standards would not have saved Hughes' life.
The 19 were freed following mediation by South Sudan's government, it adds.This is the first group to be released since about 125 children were abducted in the cross-border raid.Members of the Murle community carried out the attack. They have previously been accused of stealing livestock and children to raise as their own.More than 200 people from the rival Nuer community in Ethiopia's western Gambella province were killed in the 15 April raid.Ethiopian forces crossed into South Sudan, encircling villages where the children were held.However, the children were freed without any fighting after South Sudanese officials entered into negotiations with the abductors, the Ethiopian News Agency reports.Negotiations would continue to free all the children, it reports."The children must be rescued and be reunited with their families. The cattle that was taken should also be handed over to the right owners," South Sudan's ambassador to Ethiopia, James Pitia Morgan, is quoted as saying.Ethiopia shares a long border with South Sudan and cross-border raids involving the Murle and Nuer communities are not uncommon.However, the scale of the 15 April shocked many people in both countries, and led to protests in Ethiopia's Gambella region with parents demanding greater protection for their children.Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said "primitive and destructive forces" carried out the raid.
Priyanka Yoshikawa, 22 and who also has an elephant training licence, said she would use her win to "change perceptions".Last year, Ariana Miyamoto was the first mixed-race person to win the Miss Universe pageant.Critics complained then that a "pure" Japanese should have won.Only about 2% of babies born every year in Japan are biracial, or "haafu", the Japanese word for half."We are Japanese," Ms Yoshikawa told AFP news agency. "Yes, my dad is Indian and I'm proud of it, I'm proud that I have Indian in me. But that doesn't mean I'm not Japanese."She credited her win to Ms Miyamoto, saying she had helped show "mixed girls the way"."Before Ariana, haafu girls couldn't represent Japan," said Ms Yoshikawa. "That's what I thought too. Ariana encouraged me a lot by showing me and all mixed girls the way."I know a lot of people who are haafu and suffer," she said. "When I came back to Japan, everyone thought I was a germ.""Like if they touched me they would be touching something bad. But I'm thankful because that made me really strong."A few years ago, a woman of Indian descent, Nina Davuluri, faced Twitter abuse after being crowned Miss America. Some called her an "Arab", some a "terrorist", and some an "Arab terrorist". Indians, in large numbers, came to her defence.Now, Ms Yoshikawa is being criticised for having an Indian father and some Indians have taken to social media to advise the Japanese to "get over it". One Twitter user said she won because she "must have deserved it" while another said "after Gautam Buddha, Ms Yoshikawa is the only Indian to make it big in Japan".In Ms Yoshikawa's case - as in Ms Davuluri's before her - the biggest complaint seems to be the "lack of purity". But some are wondering whether this debate over purity has any relevance in today's globalised world.As one Twitter user said: "Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, colour, gender or country of origin."The pageant winner, also an avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, said that she hoped to change perceptions."When I'm abroad, people never ask me what mix I am. As Miss Japan, hopefully I can help change perceptions so that it can be the same here too."Ms Yoshikawa's win did not trigger the backlash that Ms Miyamoto received on social media.There were however, several on Twitter that expressed unhappiness."It's like we're saying a pure Japanese face can't be a winner," said one user."What's the point of holding a pageant like this now? Zero national characteristics," another complained.Ms Yoshikawa however, was not letting the doubters get to her."There was a time as a kid when I was confused about my identity," she said. "But I've lived in Japan so long now I feel Japanese."
The Moscow city court accepted the arguments of Russia's justice ministry that as the term "Scientology" is a registered US trademark, the Church cannot be considered a religious organisation.The organisation plans to appeal, reports said.The court set a six-month timescale for the Church to close, the ministry said.Created by science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard in 1954 and based in Los Angeles, California, the Church of Scientology has generated controversy around the world.Critics say that it is a cult and that it scams its members, while supporters maintain that it provides spiritual support to its followers.
Bristol-born Kersey-Brown grew up in Penmaenmawr and was a Wales schoolboy rugby union international.He spent five years at London Welsh before switching codes to turn professional with Huddersfield in November 1967.Kersey-Brown, who also played for Oldham, won two caps for Wales in the 1968-69 season."We're really sorry to hear that Alex has lost his long battle with cancer," Wales Rugby League's chairman Brian Juliff said."On behalf of everyone at Wales Rugby League, I would like to send our condolences to Alex's family and friends at this sad time."
The Labour leader told ITV it was "impossible" for members of his top team to remain in place if they rebelled against a three-line whip.Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens quit last week over the issue - other senior MPs say they will rebel.Mr Corbyn has ordered all Labour MPs to support the bill triggering Article 50.Labour backed the campaign to keep the UK in the EU in the referendum in June and many Labour MPs represent constituencies which voted for Remain.But many seats which voted to leave the EU are also represented by Labour MPs.Mr Corbyn says he understands the pressures on MPs in pro-Remain constituencies but has called on them to unite around the important issues.His shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has said that, since a UK-wide referendum with a 72% turnout returned a vote in favour of withdrawing from the EU, it would "be very undermining of democracy" for MPs to vote against beginning the formal process of leaving.Ms Stevens quit on Friday saying Brexit was a "terrible mistake". Shadow minister Tulip Siddiq also quit last week saying she would vote against the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.Two Labour whips, Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire, who are in charge of party discipline, have also said they will rebel - though they have not resigned.Another shadow minister Daniel Zeichner has said he will vote against the bill, as will other MPs including former Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw.Mr Corbyn told ITV's Peston on Sunday: "There was no need for anyone to resign at this stage. It's obviously impossible to carry on being in the shadow cabinet if you vote against a decision made after a very frank and very long discussion of the shadow cabinet earlier this week."Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has said divisions in the party will be handled sensitively and suggested some rebels could be back in senior roles "within months".The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was introduced after the Supreme Court ruled that parliament - not just the government alone - must vote to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the formal process of the UK leaving the EU.Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to begin the formal process of leaving by the end of March.The bill is due to be debated by MPs on Tuesday - in a sitting that may last until midnight - and clear the Commons on 8 February, after which it will move to the House of Lords.Labour has demanded changes including giving the Commons a vote on the final Brexit deal before European leaders or MEPs consider it.The Liberal Democrats have vowed to oppose the triggering of Article 50 unless there is a guarantee of another referendum on the final Brexit deal that is agreed with Brussels, while the SNP has vowed to table 50 amendments to the legislation.
He felt a problem after coming on as a second-half substitute at St James' Park and a scan showed a strain.It is the latest in a long line of injury absences for the 26-year-old, who had just returned to action after knee and foot problems.Sturridge has made six appearances so far this season, scoring four goals.Having scored 28 times for Liverpool and England in 2013-14, he was restricted to just 18 appearances last season because of thigh, calf and hip injuries.After recovering from a hip operation in May, Sturridge played three games at the start of this term but then did not feature from 4 October until 29 November.He scored twice in the 6-1 League Cup quarter-final win at Southampton last Wednesday but was hurt at Newcastle after coming on in the 62nd minute.When a foot problem picked up in training forced him to miss the Reds' Europa League win over Bordeaux on 26 November, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said Sturridge had to learn "what is serious pain and what is only pain".Liverpool, currently eighth in the Premier League, face seven games from now until the first leg of their League Cup semi-final at Stoke on 5 January.
President Joko Widodo proposed the changes in May following the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl.The laws were subject to fierce debate in parliament, with two opposition parties voting against castration.Human rights groups have objected to the punishments, arguing that violence will not be stopped by violence.The Indonesian Doctors Association said administering chemical castration would violate its professional ethics and said its members should not take part.The procedure entails injecting convicts with female hormones. It is used on sex offenders in Poland, South Korea, Russia, and some US states, among others. Prisoners in UK jails can volunteer for the treatment.The new laws also allow judges to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and applies a 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes.Human rights groups including the National Commission for Women (NCW) criticised the laws and called for them to be re-evaluated each year to test whether they are a deterrent.Azriana, the head of the NCW, said: "Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. Also it's a very expensive procedure and what we should be spending and investing our money in is services to support and help the victims."Dr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, said the administration was "praying" that the punishments "will have the desired effect".She said: "Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip. These are now law, so even if you hate the idea of them everyone now has to support this."The punishments follow a number of high profile cases of child sexual abuse in the country. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing three children at a Jakarta kindergarten.And earlier this year, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a cardboard box in Jakarta after she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and killed.
The 17-year-old fell some 40m (130ft) into a dry riverbed below. The teenager had been in a group from the Netherlands and Belgium staying at a nearby surf camp.Last month, British tourist Kleyo De Abreu died in a bungee jump off a bridge near Granada, southern Spain.She suffered fatal injuries when she hit the wall of the bridge below her.A police spokesman told Dutch media that the latest "ghastly accident" may have been caused by carelessness, although it was unclear what had gone wrong.The teenager had been taking part in a type of bungee jump known as "puenting", which involves diving with two cords attached, and then swinging beneath the bridge or viaduct.Bungee jumping has become extremely popular in Spain in recent years, both among locals and foreign tourists.Spectacular settings in rural areas of Andalusia in the south, or Cantabria and the Pyrenees in the north are common destinations both for bungee aficionados and first-timers.Companies offer both bungee jumping and its bridge-swinging variant, "puenting".There have been around 10 deaths linked to bungee jumping since it took off in the 1980s. Prior to the two fatalities this summer, the most recent was that of a 48-year-old man at Robledo de Chavela, near Madrid, in 2013.How to check your jump is safeLocal police chief Joaquin Gonzalez said he had not known that puenting took place on the bridge, adding that it was "extremely risky".The jump took place from the top of a bridge over the A8 road at Cabezon de la Sal in Cantabria.Mayor Isabel Fernandez told Dutch TV that it was an enormous tragedy. "The girl was so young. We're ready to help her family as much as we can."
Archaeologists working for the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) found the walled enclosure under the lawn in the South Ayrshire castle's Fountain Court.NTS said it probably functioned as a kitchen garden from about 1733 to 1782.As was the fashion in the late 18th Century, a new walled garden was then built out of sight from the house.This would have allowed the former site to be landscaped to improve the views from the castle.Derek Alexander, head of archaeological services for the NTS, said: "Although it was marked on the estate map, until now we never knew that any of it survived below the immaculate turf of the Fountain Court."This work has given us the perfect opportunity to explore a hidden aspect of Culzean's past and, once the lawn is re-seeded, I can't imagine the gardeners will want us digging more holes!"The garden is thought to be from work undertaken by Sir John Kennedy of Culzean, 2nd Baronet, in 1733.It can be seen on an estate map of Culzean drawn by John Foulis in 1755.The garden was abandoned in 1782 and the walls were demolished by Robert Adam's workmen as part of a wide range of improvements carried out around the castle.The drainage works, currently being carried out at Fountain Court, aim to make it suitable for staging large public events.
The landmark figure was reached in March - nine months ahead of schedule.It follows decades of global efforts and investment to get antiretroviral drugs to those in need - such as people living in sub-Saharan Africa.In 2000, when the UN first set goals to combat HIV, fewer than 700,000 people were receiving these vital medicines.According to UN Aids, which has a report out today, the global response to HIV has averted 30 million new HIV infections and nearly eight million Aids-related deaths since the millennium.Over the same time frame, new HIV infections have fallen from 2.6 million per year to 1.8 million, and Aids-related deaths have gone down from 1.6 million to 1.2 million.Meanwhile, global investment in HIV has gone up from £3.1bn ($4.8bn) in 2000 to more than £13bn ($20bn) in 2014.And concerted action over the next five years could end the Aids epidemic by 2030, says UN Aids.But progress has been slower in some areas.A major gap seems to be in awareness of HIV status, which is the biggest barrier to treatment access, says the report.And treatment access for children has lagged behind adults - although this is now improving.The proportion of children living with HIV who receive antiretroviral therapy almost doubled between 2010 and 2014 (from 14% to 32%), but coverage "remains notably lower than it does for adults", says the report.Even though new HIV infections have gone down, there is still an unacceptable number of new HIV infections each year, contributing to the burden of the epidemic.In 2014, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of all new HIV infections. And at the last headcount, there were an estimated 25.8 million people in this region living with HIV. The estimated count for the whole world was 36.9 million.This year sees the switch from Millennium Development Goals to broader Sustainable Development Goals.Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations said: "The world has delivered on halting and reversing the Aids epidemic."Now we must commit to ending the Aids epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals."The report says the next five years will be critical and recommends front-loading investment to "sprint" towards an ambition of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030.
Standing at 3ft 7in tall, James, from Colwyn Bay, was born with diastrophic dysplasia, which is known as dwarfism.When he was three-years-old he needed a major operation on his neck and then had another operation at seven where he started using lizeroth frames to straighten his legs.Now he is able to live his life as normal and now he will be carrying the Olympic torch in Rhos-on-Sea when it travels through Wales from 25-30 May.James, 23, was nominated by a friend after they met at the Beijing Paralympics in 2008 on the young advocate programme run by the British Council."I'm really excited about it and looking forward to the day," he said."It's quite an amazing privilege because the guy who nominated me I met in Beijing at the Paralympic Games. He's in London, I am in north Wales."It's quite touching."Whenever I see him, during the couple of days we are together, he always says I'm an inspiration to him and drives him to carry on with his life.The BBC's home of 2012: Latest Olympic news, sport, culture, torch relay, video and audio"I've always accepted the way I am and I strongly believe God made me the way I am."That's why I live the dream and don't let things get me down."James is a member of the Dwarf Sports Association and won the association's junior sports personality three times and held the British Class 1 badminton champion within the DSA for nine years.In nominating James, friend Russell Swannack praised him for his work within disability sport."James has worked extremely hard to encourage others to become involved in disability sport and particularly dwarf sport," he said."He went to the Beijing Paralympic Games in 2008 to empower others and this is where I was fortunate enough to meet him and be inspired by a truly incredible person who I can now call my friend."Carrying the Olympic torch would be a dream come true for James."
Official figures showed the value of sales rose by 0.1% north of the border between January and March, compared with 0.3% for the UK.Sales volumes were up by 0.7% - compared with a UK figure of 0.8%.The Scottish Retail Sales Index also showed that the volume of sales in Scotland went up by 2.7% over the year, while the value rose by just 0.1%.Scottish Retail Consortium director David Lonsdale said the return to growth was encouraging, but added there was  a "continuing fragility" in consumer confidence which was affecting retailers.He urged the next Scottish government to prioritise policies which encouraged investment and expansion in the sector.Mr Lonsdale said: "The prospects for retailers are ultimately determined by the state of the economy and their own ability to adapt and seize on the opportunities that arise."Our new MSPs can help by channelling their collective energies into ensuring that the retail industry, Scotland's largest private-sector employer, is even better-placed to be able to invest, expand and create jobs."Euan Murray, of Barclays Corporate Banking in Scotland, said the "measured increase" in the volume of sales in the first quarter had been mainly driven by food sales, in contrast with the previous three months.He added: "We are continuing to see non-food retailers benefit from a strong online offering with more value-conscious consumers comparing prices online to secure the best bargains."We would expect to see the online retail space continue to become ever more important as we move forward."Recent industry figures suggested Scotland's retailers experienced a mixed month in March.The SRC-KPMG monitor found total sales for the five weeks to 2 April were 1.3% lower than the same period last year.The non-food category saw household goods such as furniture and flooring doing well.But fashion and footwear registered its worst decline since May last year.The report said that fall was influenced by the early Easter.
His younger brother Ogbonna told BBC Sport that the former Arsenal striker is doing well after the operation."It's important to clarify that decision to operate him was reached during his annual medical check-up."We give thanks to God that everything went well and he's in perfect condition.The decision to operate him was reached during his annual medical check-up"The family would like to say a big 'thank you' to Nigerians and Nwankwo Kanu's fans across the world for their prayers and best wishes."The former Nigeria captain first had heart surgery in November 1996 to correct a faulty aortic valve.After year out, he returned to action for Inter Milan and in February 1999 joined Premier League side Arsenal.The experience prompted him to set up a foundation to build five hospitals in Africa to treat undiagnosed heart disease and provide surgery.At the weekend, the Nigerian government named Kanu among the 100 most distinguished Nigerians during a ceremony to mark the centenary of the unification of north and south Nigeria.Kanu announced his retirement from international football at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.His international success includes a Fifa under-17 World Cup title in 1993 and the 1996 Olympic football gold medal.Kanu's individual honours include African Footballer of the Year awards in 1996 and 1999.

Carwyn Scott-Howell was on holiday with family when police say he fell 160ft (49m) after straying off piste.In a statement his family said he was a "very competent skier and snowboarder".His family said they were skiing together when Carwyn's sister "lost her ski on a jump" and Carwyn skied ahead.The accident happened in Flaine, 38 miles north west of Chamonix.In their statement released through the Foreign Office, the family described Carwyn as an "adorable, caring person" who learned to ski from the age of three.The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day on Friday afternoon.It said: "The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead."The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts."The family would like to thank all their friends and family for their support at this time and the vast help from the British Consulate."Police chief Patrick Poirot, head of the mountain rescue division in the nearby town of Annecy, said yesterday that police believed the boy did not know where to go after losing his parents and skied in the wrong direction.He said: "He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff."He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell."The family have a farm in the small village of Talybont-on-Usk in the Brecon Beacons, where Carwyn's parents Ceri and Rhys run an award-winning produce business and rent holiday cottages.Liam Fitzpatrick, an independent county councillor for the village, said the community was "in absolute shock"."He was seven years old, it's horrendous. A tragic, tragic accident," he said."We just can't comprehend it."It's a small village and everyone knows each other, especially his parents who are well-known because of their business."There will be massive support here for them when they come back. The community will be ready to assist in any way it possible can."It's impossible to know what they are going through at the moment."

He later died in hospital.Irish police (gardai) have begun a murder inquiry.Vincent Ryan has also been described by police as a well-known dissident republican.A burnt-out vehicle was found near the scene of the shooting.Police are not linking Monday's murder to a gangland feud in the city that claimed two lives earlier this month.
Pippa McManus, 15, weighed about 4st (25kg) when she was being treated at The Priory in Altrincham.She was released in December 2015 and later died after stepping in front of a train near Stockport.A lack of support available to her family contributed to her death, Stockport Coroner's Court heard.The jury returned a conclusion of suicide but found the care plan when Ms McManus was discharged was inadequate and there was not enough communication with the family about her suicide risk.Inadequate community care and specialist support and a lack of cohesiveness amongst agencies were also contributory factors to her death, the court heard.Speaking after the conclusion, her mother Marie said there should have been more help available and "too many of our children are dying from this terrible illness"."Effective treatment is needed more quickly and if this had been available to our beautiful daughter, maybe she would still be alive today, maybe we would not have needed this inquest," she said.Paula Stanford, hospital director at The Priory, said: "Our heartfelt sympathies are with Pip's family and we will now carefully consider the findings of the jury."During the inquest, the hospital said her anorexia was one of the most severe cases it had seen.The coroner, Andrew Bridgman, said he will write to all of the agencies involved in her care.The inquest heard Ms McManus had a history of self-harming and had previously written a number of goodbye notes to her family, doctor, and The Priory hospital.By the age of 13, she had been diagnosed with severe anorexia and was obsessed with diet and exercise and in September 2014, was sectioned and treated at The Priory.She was released in December 2015, by which time she was not considered high risk, though she remained under hospital care.But following a family row five days later, the teenager walked to Gatley train station near her home and killed herself.Her father, Jim, said his daughter's anorexia "had too strong of a grip.""She used to say she had bad thoughts and wasn't allowed to do things - she couldn't even lick an ice-cream. She'd turn around and say I'm not allowed."Whatever was going on in her head was so strong she just couldn't comply."Her mother, Marie, said it "was just horrific" and "a nightmare.""[Pippa] hated herself. She thought she was the ugliest person in the world. Whatever you said, it didn't make a difference because that's what the anorexia was telling her."We needed some trained mental health workers to work with us but they weren't there to do that... We were let down by everybody I think. Everybody had a part to play."Deborah Coles, director of INQUEST, a charity that supported the family during the court process, said her parents' "concerns were dismissed and minimised throughout"."Pip's death has exposed a mental health system which pushed through the discharge of a highly vulnerable child without any of the support or care in place to make sure she would be safe," she said.

The numbers are set out in a report to go to the local authority next week.The council said it would allow the schools to work "more effectively and efficiently" within building capacity.The report said that secondary pupil numbers in the town had "declined significantly" over the past 20 years while primary schools had room for another 1,400 children.All four secondary schools in Dumfries are being rebuilt or refurbished under the Learning Town scheme.A new "learning hub" with room for more than 300 students is also being built.The proposals would see both Dumfries Academy and Dumfries High School have caps imposed on their S1 intake from next year which would be below average numbers for the last 20 years.The report said that the caps on intake would be reviewed each year taking into account a range of factors.It said the new combined capacity of secondary schools would be "more than enough" to meet the needs of the town.Figures for the primary schools show all of them would have a maximum intake set at or above their 20-year average except for schools planned to move to new sites.The school rolls at St Ninian's and Lochside will be combined from August 2018 while figures for Loreburn Primary have been based on plans to move it to part of a central campus including Dumfries Academy.Ae Primary, Caerlaverock Primary, Kirkbean Primary, Locharbriggs Primary and St Teresa's Primary are part of a "low utilisation" review.
The 25-year-old has agreed a three-year contract at the Madejski Stadium.His arrival comes after it was revealed veteran striker Yann Kermorgant will miss the start of the season following surgery on his hip and groin.Bodvarsson joined Wolves from Kaiserslautern last summer, scoring three goals in 48 appearances."Jon is the type of player who can play in our system and he is able to play in a number up different positions within that system too - up front as a central striker, as one of a two or as a winger," Royals boss Jaap Stam told the club website."He's a strong runner, he's tall but he's very comfortable on the ball, he's got some pace, so he's definitely a player who will be a useful addition to our squad."Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

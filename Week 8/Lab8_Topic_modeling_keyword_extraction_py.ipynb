        "\n",
        "Topic extraction from text is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task that involves automatically identifying and categorizing the main themes or subjects present in a collection of textual documents. This unsupervised method is motivated by the need to efficiently organize and summarize large volumes of text data, making it more manageable and informative. By automatically uncovering latent topics within the text, topic extraction helps in various applications, including document clustering, recommendation systems, content summarization, and content understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a news website that publishes articles on various topics like politics, sports, technology, and entertainment. Using unsupervised topic extraction, we can automatically categorize each article into its respective topic without needing manual labels. This allows the website to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Organize articles on its homepage by topics, making it easier for users to navigate and find articles of interest.\n",
        "- Recommend related articles to readers based on their past reading history, leveraging the identified topics.\n",
        "- Perform sentiment analysis on each topic to gauge public sentiment on current events or issues."

        "The Gensim library provides a widely used implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. LDA is a probabilistic generative model that assumes each document is a mixture of topics, and each word in a document is attributable to one of the document's topics. It iteratively uncovers these topics from the given text corpus."

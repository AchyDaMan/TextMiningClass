        "Welcome to TweetMiner, the leading organization in Twitter data analysis! As an NLP scientist in our team, you're entrusted with the task of extracting the most relevant tweets based on input hashtags. For instance, if the hashtag is \"#abortion,\" we expect you to extract the top N (let's say N=10) tweets that truly discuss the topic of \"abortion.\" Similarly, for a hashtag like \"#politicaladvertising,\" your algorithm should identify and extract the top N (again, let's use N=10) tweets about \"political advertising\".\n",
